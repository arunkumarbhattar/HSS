   In the thread-specific locale model (see `uselocale' in <locale.h>)
   we cannot use global variables for these as was done in the past.
   Instead, the following accessor functions return the address of
   each variable, which is local to the current thread if multithreaded.

   These point into arrays of 384, so they can be indexed by any `unsigned
   char' value [0,255]; by EOF (-1); or by any `signed char' value
   [-128,-1).  ISO C requires that the ctype functions work for `unsigned
   char' values and for EOF; we also support negative `signed char' values
   for broken old programs.  The case conversion arrays are of `int's
   rather than `unsigned char's because tolower (EOF) must be EOF, which
   doesn't fit into an `unsigned char'.  But today more important is that
   the arrays are also used for multi-byte character sets.  *//* ! _ISbit  *//* These are all the characteristics of characters.
   If there get to be more than 16 distinct characteristics,
   many things must be changed that use `unsigned short int's.

   The characteristics are stored always in network byte order (big
   endian).  We define the bit value interpretations here dependent on the
   machine's byte order.  *//*

 * FALLOC_FL_UNSHARE_RANGE is used to unshare shared blocks within the
 * file size without overwriting any existing data. The purpose of this
 * call is to preemptively reallocate any blocks that are subject to
 * copy-on-write.
 *
 * Different filesystems may implement different limitations on the
 * granularity of the operation. Most will limit operations to filesystem
 * block size boundaries, but this boundary may be larger or smaller
 * depending on the filesystem and/or the configuration of the filesystem
 * or file.
 *
 * This flag can only be used with allocate-mode fallocate, which is
 * to say that it cannot be used with the punch, zero, collapse, or
 * insert range modes.
 *//*
 * FALLOC_FL_INSERT_RANGE is use to insert space within the file size without
 * overwriting any existing data. The contents of the file beyond offset are
 * shifted towards right by len bytes to create a hole.  As such, this
 * operation will increase the size of the file by len bytes.
 *
 * Different filesystems may implement different limitations on the granularity
 * of the operation. Most will limit operations to filesystem block size
 * boundaries, but this boundary may be larger or smaller depending on
 * the filesystem and/or the configuration of the filesystem or file.
 *
 * Attempting to insert space using this flag at OR beyond the end of
 * the file is considered an illegal operation - just use ftruncate(2) or
 * fallocate(2) with mode 0 for such type of operations.
 *//*
 * FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE is used to convert a range of file to zeros preferably
 * without issuing data IO. Blocks should be preallocated for the regions that
 * span holes in the file, and the entire range is preferable converted to
 * unwritten extents - even though file system may choose to zero out the
 * extent or do whatever which will result in reading zeros from the range
 * while the range remains allocated for the file.
 *
 * This can be also used to preallocate blocks past EOF in the same way as
 * with fallocate. Flag FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE should cause the inode
 * size to remain the same.
 *//*
 * FALLOC_FL_COLLAPSE_RANGE is used to remove a range of a file
 * without leaving a hole in the file. The contents of the file beyond
 * the range being removed is appended to the start offset of the range
 * being removed (i.e. the hole that was punched is "collapsed"),
 * resulting in a file layout that looks like the range that was
 * removed never existed. As such collapsing a range of a file changes
 * the size of the file, reducing it by the same length of the range
 * that has been removed by the operation.
 *
 * Different filesystems may implement different limitations on the
 * granularity of the operation. Most will limit operations to
 * filesystem block size boundaries, but this boundary may be larger or
 * smaller depending on the filesystem and/or the configuration of the
 * filesystem or file.
 *
 * Attempting to collapse a range that crosses the end of the file is
 * considered an illegal operation - just use ftruncate(2) if you need
 * to collapse a range that crosses EOF.

   be a compiler bug or a ranlib bug.  *//* We need a sign, whether a new catalog was loaded, which can be associated
   with all translations.  This is important if the translations are
   cached by one of GCC's features.  *//* On reasonable systems, binary I/O is the default.  *//* BeOS 5 has O_BINARY and O_TEXT, but they have no effect.  *//* For systems that distinguish between text and binary I/O.
   O_BINARY is usually declared in <fcntl.h>. *//* On native Windows, don't require linking with '-loldnames'.  *//* Rename the non ISO C functions.  This is required by the standard
   because some ISO C functions will require linking with this object
   file and the name space must not be polluted.  *//* Provide fallback values for macros that ought to be defined in <inttypes.h>.
   Note that our fallback values need not be literal strings, because we don't
   use them with preprocessor string concatenation.  *//* Load needed message catalogs.

`--------------------------------------*//* Now 'shift' the result of the reduction.  Determine what state
     that goes to, based on the state we popped back to and the rule
     number reduced by.  *//* User semantic actions sometimes alter yychar, and that requires
     that yytoken be updated with the new translation.  We take the
     approach of translating immediately before every use of yytoken.
     One alternative is translating here after every semantic action,
     but that translation would be missed if the semantic action invokes
     YYABORT, YYACCEPT, or YYERROR immediately after altering yychar or
     if it invokes YYBACKUP.  In the case of YYABORT or YYACCEPT, an
     incorrect destructor might then be invoked immediately.  In the
     case of YYERROR or YYBACKUP, subsequent parser actions might lead
     to an incorrect destructor call or verbose syntax error message
     before the lookahead is translated.  *//* If YYLEN is nonzero, implement the default value of the action:
     '$$ = $1'.

     Otherwise, the following line sets YYVAL to garbage.
     This behavior is undocumented and Bison
     users should not rely upon it.  Assigning to YYVAL
     unconditionally makes the parser a bit smaller, and it avoids a

             YYCHECK.  In other words, skip the first -YYN actions for
             this state because they are default actions.  *//* There are many possibilities here to consider:
     - If this state is a consistent state with a default action, then
       the only way this function was invoked is if the default action
       is an error action.  In that case, don't check for expected
       tokens because there are none.
     - The only way there can be no lookahead present (in yychar) is if
       this state is a consistent state with a default action.  Thus,
       detecting the absence of a lookahead is sufficient to determine
       that there is no unexpected or expected token to report.  In that
       case, just report a simple "syntax error".
     - Don't assume there isn't a lookahead just because this state is a
       consistent state with a default action.  There might have been a
       previous inconsistent state, consistent state with a non-default
       action, or user semantic action that manipulated yychar.
     - Of course, the expected token list depends on states to have
       correct lookahead information, and it depends on the parser not
       to perform extra reductions after fetching a lookahead from the
       scanner and before detecting a syntax error.  Thus, state merging
       (from LALR or IELR) and default reductions corrupt the expected
       token list.  However, the list is correct for canonical LR with
       one exception: it will still contain any token that will not be
       accepted due to an error action in a later state.
  *//* Cumulated lengths of YYARG.  *//* Actual size of YYARG. *//* Arguments of yyformat: reported tokens (one for the "unexpected",
     one per "expected"). *//* Internationalized format string. *//* Copy into *YYMSG, which is of size *YYMSG_ALLOC, an error message
   about the unexpected token YYTOKEN for the state stack whose top is
   YYSSP.

   Return 0 if *YYMSG was successfully written.  Return 1 if *YYMSG is
   not large enough to hold the message.  In that case, also set
   *YYMSG_ALLOC to the required number of bytes.  Return 2 if the
   required number of bytes is too large to store.  *//* Copy to YYRES the contents of YYSTR after stripping away unnecessary
   quotes and backslashes, so that it's suitable for yyerror.  The
   heuristic is that double-quoting is unnecessary unless the string
   contains an apostrophe, a comma, or backslash (other than
   backslash-backslash).  YYSTR is taken from yytname.  If YYRES is
   null, do not copy; instead, return the length of what the result
   would have been.  *//* Copy YYSRC to YYDEST, returning the address of the terminating '\0' in
   YYDEST.  *//* Return the length of YYSTR.  *//* YYMAXDEPTH -- maximum size the stacks can grow to (effective only
   if the built-in stack extension method is used).

   Do not make this value too large; the results are undefined if

 *//* Return string representation of locale category CATEGORY.  *//* Get _nl_msg_cat_cntr declaration.  *//* Override setlocale() and newlocale() so that when the default locale is
   requested (locale = "") and no relevant environment variable is set, the

   *  @defgroup io I/O
   *
   *  Nearly all of the I/O classes are parameterized on the type of
   *  characters they read and write.  (The major exception is ios_base at
   *  the top of the hierarchy.)  This is a change from pre-Standard
   *  streams, which were not templates.
   *
   *  For ease of use and compatibility, all of the basic_* I/O-related
   *  classes are given typedef names for both of the builtin character
   *  widths (wide and narrow).  The typedefs are the same as the
   *  pre-Standard names, for example:
   *
   *  @code
   *     typedef basic_ifstream<char>  ifstream;
   *  @endcode
   *
   *  Because properly forward-declaring these classes can be difficult, you
   *  should not do it yourself.  Instead, include the &lt;iosfwd&gt;
   *  header, which contains only declarations of all the I/O classes as
   *  well as the typedefs.  Trying to forward-declare the typedefs
   *  themselves (e.g., <code>class ostream;</code>) is not valid ISO C++.
   *

   *  Binders turn functions/functors with two arguments into functors
   *  with a single argument, storing an argument to be applied later.
   *  For example, a variable @c B of type @c binder1st is constructed
   *  from a functor @c f and an argument @c x. Later, B's @c
   *  operator() is called with a single argument @c y. The return
   *  value is the value of @c f(x,y). @c B can be @a called with
   *  various arguments (y1, y2, ...) and will in turn call @c
   *  f(x,y1), @c f(x,y2), ...
   *
   *  The function @c bind1st is provided to save some typing. It takes the
   *  function and an argument as parameters, and returns an instance of
   *  @c binder1st.
   *
   *  The type @c binder2nd and its creator function @c bind2nd do the same
   *  thing, but the stored argument is passed as the second parameter instead
   *  of the first, e.g., @c bind2nd(std::minus<float>(),1.3) will create a
   *  functor whose @c operator() accepts a floating-point number, subtracts
   *  1.3 from it, and returns the result. (If @c bind1st had been used,
   *  the functor would perform <em>1.3 - x</em> instead.
   *
   *  Creator-wrapper functions like @c bind1st are intended to be used in
   *  calling algorithms. Their return values will be temporary objects.
   *  (The goal is to not require you to type names like
   *  @c std::binder1st<std::plus<int>> for declaring a variable to hold the
   *  return value from @c bind1st(std::plus<int>(),5).
   *
   *  These become more useful when combined with the composition functions.
   *
   *  These functions are deprecated in C++11 and can be replaced by
   *  @c std::bind (or @c std::tr1::bind) which is more powerful and flexible,
   *  supporting functions with any number of arguments.  Uses of @c bind1st
   *  can be replaced by @c std::bind(f, x, std::placeholders::_1) and
   *  @c bind2nd by @c std::bind(f, std::placeholders::_1, x).

   *
   *  The advantage of function objects over pointers to functions is that
   *  the objects in the standard library declare nested typedefs describing
   *  their argument and result types with uniform names (e.g., @c result_type
   *  from the base classes @c unary_function and @c binary_function).
   *  Sometimes those typedefs are required, not just optional.
   *
   *  Adaptors are provided to turn pointers to unary (single-argument) and
   *  binary (double-argument) functions into function objects.  The
   *  long-winded functor @c pointer_to_unary_function is constructed with a
   *  function pointer @c f, and its @c operator() called with argument @c x
   *  returns @c f(x).  The functor @c pointer_to_binary_function does the same
   *  thing, but with a double-argument @c f and @c operator().
   *
   *  The function @c ptr_fun takes a pointer-to-function @c f and constructs
   *  an instance of the appropriate functor.

   *  the negation of the result.
   *

   *  Function objects, or @e functors, are objects with an @c operator()
   *  defined and accessible.  They can be passed as arguments to algorithm
   *  templates and used in place of a function pointer.  Not only is the
   *  resulting expressiveness of the library increased, but the generated
   *  code can be more efficient than what you might write by hand.  When we
   *  refer to @a functors, then, generally we include function pointers in
   *  the description as well.
   *
   *  Often, functors are only created as temporaries passed to algorithm
   *  calls, rather than being created as named variables.
   *
   *  Two examples taken from the standard itself follow.  To perform a
   *  by-element addition of two vectors @c a and @c b containing @c double,
   *  and put the result in @c a, use
   *  \code
   *  transform (a.begin(), a.end(), b.begin(), a.begin(), plus<double>());
   *  \endcode
   *  To negate every element in @c a, use
   *  \code
   *  transform(a.begin(), a.end(), a.begin(), negate<double>());
   *  \endcode
   *  The addition and negation functions will be inlined directly.
   *
   *  The standard functors are derived from structs named @c unary_function
   *  and @c binary_function.  These two classes contain nothing but typedefs,
   *  to aid in generic (template) programming.  If you write your own
   *  functors, you might consider doing the same.

   calls in shared flavors of the HP-UX C library.  Most of the stubs
   have no functionality.  The details are described in the "libc cumulative
   patch" for each subversion of HP-UX 11.  There are two special interfaces
   provided for checking whether an application is linked to a shared pthread
   library or not.  However, these interfaces aren't available in early
   libpthread libraries.  We also need a test that works for archive
   libraries.  We can't use pthread_once as some libc versions call the
   init function.  We also can't use pthread_create or pthread_attr_init
   as these create a thread and thereby prevent changing the default stack
   size.  The function pthread_default_stacksize_np is available in both
   the archive and shared versions of libpthread.   It can be used to
   determine the default pthread stack size.  There is a stub in some
   shared libc versions which returns a zero size if pthreads are not
   active.  We provide an equivalent stub to handle cases where libc
   doesn't provide one.  *//* not __GXX_WEAK__ *//* FreeBSD or Solaris *//* For a program to be multi-threaded the only thing that it certainly must
   be using is pthread_create.  However, there may be other libraries that
   intercept pthread_create with their own definitions to wrap pthreads
   functionality for some purpose.  In those cases, pthread_create being
   defined might not necessarily mean that libpthread is actually linked
   in.

   For the GNU C library, we can use a known internal name.  This is always
   available in the ABI, but no other library would define it.  That is
   ideal, since any public pthread function might be intercepted just as
   pthread_create might be.  __pthread_key_create is an "internal"
   implementation symbol, but it is part of the public exported ABI.  Also,
   it's among the symbols that the static libpthread.a always links in
   whenever pthread_create is used, so there is no danger of a false
   negative result in any statically-linked, multi-threaded program.

   For others, we choose pthread_cancel as a function that seems unlikely
   to be redefined by an interceptor library.  The bionic (Android) C
   library does not provide pthread_cancel, so we do use pthread_create
   there (and interceptor libraries lose).  *//* neither FreeBSD nor Solaris *//* Make sure we'll never enter this block again.  *//* If this really is a threaded program, then we must ensure that
	     __gthread_active has been set to 1 before exiting this block.  *//* This test is not protected to avoid taking a lock on the main code
     path so every update of __gthread_active in a threaded program must
     be atomic with regard to the result of the test.  *//* On Solaris 2.6 up to 9, the libc exposes a POSIX threads interface even if
   -pthreads is not specified.  The functions are dummies and most return an
   error value.  However pthread_once returns 0 without invoking the routine
   it is passed so we cannot pretend that the interface is active if -pthreads
   is not specified.  On Solaris 2.5.1, the interface is not exposed at all so
   we need to play the usual game with weak symbols.  On Solaris 10 and up, a
   working interface is always exposed.  On FreeBSD 6 and later, libc also
   exposes a dummy POSIX threads interface, similar to what Solaris 2.6 up
   to 9 does.  FreeBSD >= 700014 even provides a pthread_cancel stub in libc,
   which means the alternate __gthread_active_p below cannot be used there.  *//* _LIBOBJC || _LIBOBJC_WEAK *//* Objective-C.  *//* Typically, __gthrw_foo is a weak reference to symbol foo.  *//* POSIX like conditional variables are supported.  Please look at comments
   in gthr.h for details. *//* POSIX threads specific definitions.
   Easy, since the interface is just one-to-one mapping.  *//* Copyright (C) 1997-2019 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

   to indicate that threads support is present.  Also it has define

   that returns 1 if thread system is active, 0 if not.

   The threads interface must define the following types:
     __gthread_key_t
     __gthread_once_t
     __gthread_mutex_t
     __gthread_recursive_mutex_t

   The threads interface must define the following macros:

     __GTHREAD_ONCE_INIT
     		to initialize __gthread_once_t
     __GTHREAD_MUTEX_INIT
     		to initialize __gthread_mutex_t to get a fast
		non-recursive mutex.
     __GTHREAD_MUTEX_INIT_FUNCTION
		to initialize __gthread_mutex_t to get a fast
		non-recursive mutex.
		Define this to a function which looks like this:
		  void __GTHREAD_MUTEX_INIT_FUNCTION (__gthread_mutex_t *)
     		Some systems can't initialize a mutex without a
		function call.  Don't define __GTHREAD_MUTEX_INIT in this case.
     __GTHREAD_RECURSIVE_MUTEX_INIT
     __GTHREAD_RECURSIVE_MUTEX_INIT_FUNCTION
     		as above, but for a recursive mutex.

   The threads interface must define the following static functions:

     int __gthread_once (__gthread_once_t *once, void (*func) ())

     int __gthread_key_create (__gthread_key_t *keyp, void (*dtor) (void *))
     int __gthread_key_delete (__gthread_key_t key)

     void *__gthread_getspecific (__gthread_key_t key)
     int __gthread_setspecific (__gthread_key_t key, const void *ptr)

     int __gthread_mutex_destroy (__gthread_mutex_t *mutex);
     int __gthread_recursive_mutex_destroy (__gthread_recursive_mutex_t *mutex);

     int __gthread_mutex_lock (__gthread_mutex_t *mutex);
     int __gthread_mutex_trylock (__gthread_mutex_t *mutex);
     int __gthread_mutex_unlock (__gthread_mutex_t *mutex);

     int __gthread_recursive_mutex_lock (__gthread_recursive_mutex_t *mutex);
     int __gthread_recursive_mutex_trylock (__gthread_recursive_mutex_t *mutex);
     int __gthread_recursive_mutex_unlock (__gthread_recursive_mutex_t *mutex);

   The following are supported in POSIX threads only. They are required to
   fix a deadlock in static initialization inside libsupc++. The header file
   gthr-posix.h defines a symbol __GTHREAD_HAS_COND to signify that these extra
   features are supported.

   Types:
     __gthread_cond_t

   Macros:
     __GTHREAD_COND_INIT
     __GTHREAD_COND_INIT_FUNCTION

   Interface:
     int __gthread_cond_broadcast (__gthread_cond_t *cond);
     int __gthread_cond_wait (__gthread_cond_t *cond, __gthread_mutex_t *mutex);
     int __gthread_cond_wait_recursive (__gthread_cond_t *cond,
					__gthread_recursive_mutex_t *mutex);

   All functions returning int should return zero on success or the error
   number.  If the operation is not supported, -1 is returned.

   If the following are also defined, you should
     #define __GTHREADS_CXX0X 1
   to enable the c++0x thread library.

   Types:
     __gthread_t
     __gthread_time_t

   Interface:

   *
   *
   *  Documentation?  What's that?
   *  Nathan Myers <ncm@cantrip.org>.
   *
   *  A string looks like this:
   *
   *  @code
   *                                        [_Rep]
   *                                        _M_length
   *   [basic_string<char_type>]            _M_capacity
   *   _M_dataplus                          _M_refcount
   *   _M_p ---------------->               unnamed array of char_type
   *  @endcode
   *
   *  Where the _M_p points to the first character in the string, and
   *  you cast it to a pointer-to-_Rep and subtract 1 to get a
   *  pointer to the header.
   *
   *  This approach has the enormous advantage that a string object
   *  requires only one allocation.  All the ugliness is confined
   *  within a single %pair of inline functions, which each compile to
   *  a single @a add instruction: _Rep::_M_data(), and
   *  string::_M_rep(); and the allocation function which gets a
   *  block of raw bytes and with room enough and constructs a _Rep
   *  object at the front.
   *
   *  The reason you want _M_data pointing to the character %array and
   *  not the _Rep is so that the debugger can see the string
   *  contents. (Probably we should add a non-inline member to get
   *  the _Rep for the debugger to use, so users can check the actual
   *  string length.)
   *
   *  Note that the _Rep object is a POD so that you can have a
   *  static <em>empty string</em> _Rep object already @a constructed before
   *  static constructors have run.  The reference-count encoding is
   *  chosen so that a 0 indicates one reference, so you never try to
   *  destroy the empty-string _Rep object.
   *

   *  for a C++ string implementation.

   *
   *  This is a base class.  Derived stream buffers each control a
   *  pair of character sequences:  one for input, and one for output.
   *
   *  Section [27.5.1] of the standard describes the requirements and
   *  behavior of stream buffer classes.  That section (three paragraphs)
   *  is reproduced here, for simplicity and accuracy.
   *
   *  -# Stream buffers can impose various constraints on the sequences
   *     they control.  Some constraints are:
   *     - The controlled input sequence can be not readable.
   *     - The controlled output sequence can be not writable.
   *     - The controlled sequences can be associated with the contents of
   *       other representations for character sequences, such as external
   *       files.
   *     - The controlled sequences can support operations @e directly to or
   *       from associated sequences.
   *     - The controlled sequences can impose limitations on how the
   *       program can read characters from a sequence, write characters to
   *       a sequence, put characters back into an input sequence, or alter
   *       the stream position.
   *     .
   *  -# Each sequence is characterized by three pointers which, if non-null,
   *     all point into the same @c charT array object.  The array object
   *     represents, at any moment, a (sub)sequence of characters from the
   *     sequence.  Operations performed on a sequence alter the values
   *     stored in these pointers, perform reads and writes directly to or
   *     from associated sequences, and alter <em>the stream position</em> and
   *     conversion state as needed to maintain this subsequence relationship.
   *     The three pointers are:
   *     - the <em>beginning pointer</em>, or lowest element address in the
   *       array (called @e xbeg here);
   *     - the <em>next pointer</em>, or next element address that is a
   *       current candidate for reading or writing (called @e xnext here);
   *     - the <em>end pointer</em>, or first element address beyond the
   *       end of the array (called @e xend here).
   *     .
   *  -# The following semantic constraints shall always apply for any set
   *     of three pointers for a sequence, using the pointer names given
   *     immediately above:
   *     - If @e xnext is not a null pointer, then @e xbeg and @e xend shall
   *       also be non-null pointers into the same @c charT array, as
   *       described above; otherwise, @e xbeg and @e xend shall also be null.
   *     - If @e xnext is not a null pointer and @e xnext < @e xend for an
   *       output sequence, then a <em>write position</em> is available.
   *       In this case, @e *xnext shall be assignable as the next element
   *       to write (to put, or to store a character value, into the sequence).
   *     - If @e xnext is not a null pointer and @e xbeg < @e xnext for an
   *       input sequence, then a <em>putback position</em> is available.
   *       In this case, @e xnext[-1] shall have a defined value and is the
   *       next (preceding) element to store a character that is put back
   *       into the input sequence.
   *     - If @e xnext is not a null pointer and @e xnext< @e xend for an
   *       input sequence, then a <em>read position</em> is available.
   *       In this case, @e *xnext shall have a defined value and is the
   *       next element to read (to get, or to obtain a character value,
   *       from the sequence).

       *  The basic format is affected by the value of io.flags() &
       *  ios_base::floatfield.  If equal to ios_base::fixed, formats like the
       *  printf %f specifier.  Else if equal to ios_base::scientific, formats
       *  like %e or %E with ios_base::uppercase unset or set respectively.
       *  Otherwise, formats like %g or %G depending on uppercase.  Note that
       *  if both fixed and scientific are set, the effect will also be like
       *  %g or %G.
       *
       *  The output precision is given by io.precision().  This precision is

       *  - the input stream reaches end-of-file,

       *  constructing a temporary object of type std::basic_ostream::sentry.

       *  status flag; see the sentry documentation for more.
       *
       *  If the sentry status is good, the function tries to generate
       *  whatever data is appropriate for the type of the argument.
       *
       *  If an exception is thrown during insertion, ios_base::badbit
       *  will be turned on in the stream's error state without causing an
       *  ios_base::failure to be thrown.  The original exception will then
       *  be rethrown.

       *  This function behaves like one of the basic arithmetic extractors,

       *  handling behavior.
       *
       *  If @p __sb is NULL, the stream will set failbit in its error state.
       *
       *  Characters are extracted from this stream and inserted into the
       *  @p __sb streambuf until one of the following occurs:
       *
       *  - the input stream reaches end-of-file,
       *  - insertion into the output buffer fails (in this case, the
       *    character that would have been inserted is not extracted), or
       *  - an exception occurs (and in this case is caught)
       *
       *  If the function inserts no characters, failbit is set.

     type mismatches in all the code that assumes it is an int.  *//* Describe the long-named options requested by the application.
   The LONG_OPTIONS argument to getopt_long or getopt_long_only is a vector
   of 'struct option' terminated by an element containing a name which is
   zero.

   The field 'has_arg' is:
   no_argument		(or 0) if the option does not take an argument,
   required_argument	(or 1) if the option requires an argument,
   optional_argument 	(or 2) if the option takes an optional argument.

   If the field 'flag' is not NULL, it points to a variable that is set
   to the value given in the field 'val' when the option is found, but
   left unchanged if the option is not found.

   To have a long-named option do something other than set an 'int' to
   a compiled-in constant, such as set a value from 'optarg', set the
   option's 'flag' field to zero and its 'val' field to a nonzero
   value (the equivalent single-letter option character, if there is
   one).  For long options that have a zero 'flag' field, 'getopt'
   returns the contents of the 'val' field.  *//* This header should not be used directly; include getopt.h instead.
   Unlike most bits headers, it does not have a protective #error,
   because the guard macro for getopt.h in gnulib is not fixed.  *//* Declarations for getopt (GNU extensions).

     extern "C" {
     #endif
     _GL_NORETURN_FUNC void func (void);
     #ifdef __cplusplus
     }
     #endif
   Use in C & C++ code for a function with current language linkage:
     _GL_NORETURN_FUNC extern void func (void);
 *//* A "non-returning" function is a function which cannot return normally.
   It can transfer control only through longjmp(), throw (in C++), or similar
   mechanisms.

   This file defines two macros _GL_NORETURN_FUNC and _GL_NORETURN_FUNCPTR,
   that declare a function to be non-returning.
   _GL_NORETURN_FUNC is for use in function declarations and function
   definitions.
   _GL_NORETURN_FUNCPTR is for use on function pointers.

   Comparison of this file with <stdnoreturn.h>:
   <stdnoreturn.h> defines a macro (or keyword) _Noreturn that declares
   a function to be non-returning.  _Noreturn is only for use in function
   declarations and function definitions.
   Therefore, if the non-returning functions you have to declare are unlikely
   to be accessed through function pointers, and if the efficiency with C++
   compilers other than g++, clang, MSVC++ is not an issue to you, you can use
   module 'stdnoreturn' instead of this one, and _Noreturn instead of
   _GL_NORETURN_FUNC.

   "unknown type name" problems on Cygwin.  *//* On many platforms, <sys/select.h> assumes prior inclusion of

   in <signal.h> where it belongs.  *//* On OpenBSD 5.0, <pthread.h> includes <sys/types.h>, which includes
   <sys/select.h>.  At this point we cannot include <signal.h>, because that
   includes gnulib's pthread.h override, which gives a syntax error because
   /usr/include/pthread.h has not been completely processed.  Simply delegate
   to the system's header in this case.  *//* On IRIX 6.5, <sys/timespec.h> includes <sys/types.h>, which includes

   The returned value points to static storage that can be
   reused by the next call to this function with the same value of N.
   N must be nonnegative.  The output of all functions in the
   quotearg_n family are guaranteed to not contain embedded null
   bytes.*//* Like quotearg_alloc, except that the length of the result,
   excluding the terminating null byte, is stored into SIZE if it is
   non-NULL.  The result might contain embedded null bytes if ARGSIZE
   was not -1, SIZE was not NULL, the style of O does not use
   backslash escapes, and the flags of O do not request elision of
   null bytes.*//* Like quotearg_buffer, except return the result in a newly allocated

   size of the output, not counting the terminating null.
   If BUFFERSIZE is too small to store the output string, return the
   value that would have been returned had BUFFERSIZE been large enough.
   If ARGSIZE is -1, use the string length of the argument for ARGSIZE.
   On output, BUFFER might contain embedded null bytes if ARGSIZE was
   not -1, the style of O does not use backslash escapes, and the
   flags of O do not request elision of null bytes.*//* In O (or in the default if O is null),
   set the value of the quoting style to custom_quoting_style,
   set the left quote to LEFT_QUOTE, and set the right quote to
   RIGHT_QUOTE.  Each of LEFT_QUOTE and RIGHT_QUOTE must be
   null-terminated and can be the empty string.  Because backslashes are
   used for escaping, it does not make sense for RIGHT_QUOTE to contain
   a backslash.  RIGHT_QUOTE must not begin with a digit or a letter
   that has special meaning after a backslash (for example, "\t" for
   tab).  *//* In O (or in the default if O is null),

   Return the old value.  Currently, the only values defined for I are
   0 (the default) and 1 (which means to quote the character even if
   it would not otherwise be quoted).  C must never be a digit or a
   letter that has special meaning after a backslash (for example, "\t"
   for tab).  *//* In O (or in the default if O is null),
   set the value of the quoting style to S.  *//* Get the value of O's quoting style.  If O is null, use the default.  *//* Allocate a new set of quoting options, with contents initially identical

   that contains the default quoting style options.  *//* Names of quoting styles and their corresponding values.  *//* For now, --quoting-style=literal is the default, but this may change.  *//* In the c_quoting_style and c_maybe_quoting_style, split ANSI
       trigraph sequences into concatenated strings (for example,
       "?""?/" rather than "??/", which could be confused with

       are encountered.  Note that if no other character needs
       escaping, then neither does the escape character.  *//* Always elide null bytes from styles that do not quote them,

       caller.  *//* Flags for use in set_quoting_flags.  *//* Like clocale_quoting_style except use the custom quotation marks

   section 2.4.3 Signal Actions.

   This module provides spin locks with a similar API.  It can be used like this,
   both in regular multithreaded code and in signal handlers:

       sigset_t saved_mask;
       asyncsafe_spin_lock (&lock, &mask, &saved_mask);
       do_something_contentious ();
       asyncsafe_spin_unlock (&lock, &saved_mask);

   The mask you specify here is the set of signals whose handlers might want to
   take the same lock.

   asyncsafe_spin_lock/unlock use pthread_sigmask, to ensure that while a thread
   is executing such code, no signal handler will start such code for the same
   lock *in the same thread* (because if this happened, the signal handler would
   hang!).  *//* Spin locks for communication between threads and signal handlers.

     For some examples, 'banana' has two critical factorizations, both
     exposed by the two lexicographic extreme suffixes of 'anana' and
     'nana', where both suffixes have a period of 2.  On the other
     hand, with 'aab' and 'bba', both strings have a single critical
     factorization of the last byte, with the suffix having a period
     of 1.  While the maximal lexicographic suffix of 'aab' is 'b',
     the maximal lexicographic suffix of 'bba' is 'ba', which is not a
     critical factorization.  Conversely, the maximal reverse
     lexicographic suffix of 'a' works for 'bba', but not 'ab' for
     'aab'.  The shorter suffix of the two will always be a critical
     factorization.  *//* Suffix is larger, start over from current location.  *//* a < b *//* Advance through repetition of the current period.  *//* Suffix is smaller, period is entire prefix so far.  *//* Perform reverse lexicographic search.  *//* b < a *//* Perform lexicographic search.  *//* Invariants:
     0 <= j < NEEDLE_LEN - 1
     -1 <= max_suffix{,_rev} < j (treating SIZE_MAX as if it were signed)
     min(max_suffix, max_suffix_rev) < global period of NEEDLE
     1 <= p <= global period of NEEDLE
     p == global period of the substring NEEDLE[max_suffix{,_rev}+1...j]

   Return the index of the first byte in the right half, and set
   *PERIOD to the global period of the right half.

   The global period of a string is the smallest index (possibly its
   length) at which all remaining bytes in the string are repetitions
   of the prefix (the last repetition may be a subset of the prefix).

   When NEEDLE is factored into two halves, a local period is the
   length of the smallest word that shares a suffix with the left half
   and shares a prefix with the right half.  All factorizations of a
   non-empty NEEDLE have a local period of at least 1 and no greater
   than NEEDLE_LEN.

   A critical factorization has the property that the local period
   equals the global period.  All strings have at least one critical
   factorization with the left half smaller than the global period.
   And while some strings have more than one critical factorization,
   it is provable that with an ordered alphabet, at least one of the
   critical factorizations corresponds to a maximal suffix.

   Given an ordered alphabet, a critical factorization can be computed
   in linear time, with 2 * NEEDLE_LEN comparisons, by computing the
   shorter of two ordered maximal suffixes.  The ordered maximal
   suffixes are determined by lexicographic comparison while tracking
   periodicity.  *//* Point at which computing a bad-byte shift table is likely to be
   worthwhile.  Small needles should not compute a table, since it
   adds (1 << CHAR_BIT) + NEEDLE_LEN computations of preparation for a
   speedup no greater than a factor of NEEDLE_LEN.  The larger the
   needle, the better the potential performance gain.  On the other
   hand, on non-POSIX systems with CHAR_BIT larger than eight, the
   memory required for the table is prohibitive.  *//* We use the Two-Way string matching algorithm (also known as
   Chrochemore-Perrin), which guarantees linear complexity with
   constant space.  Additionally, for long needles, we also use a bad
   character shift table similar to the Boyer-Moore algorithm to
   achieve improved (potentially sub-linear) performance.

This interface is deprecated.
   FIXME: Remove in 2022.  *//* If ENTRY is already in the table, remove it and return the just-deleted
   data (the user may want to deallocate its storage).  If ENTRY is not in the
   table, don't modify the table and return NULL.  *//* Insert ENTRY into hash TABLE if there is not already a matching entry.

   Return -1 upon memory allocation failure.
   Return 1 if insertion succeeded.
   Return 0 if there is already a matching entry in the table,
   and in that case, if MATCHED_ENT is non-NULL, set *MATCHED_ENT
   to that entry.

   This interface is easier to use than hash_insert when you must
   distinguish between the latter two cases.  More importantly,
   hash_insert is unusable for some types of ENTRY values.  When using
   hash_insert, the only way to distinguish those cases is to compare
   the return value and ENTRY.  That works only when you can have two
   different ENTRY values that point to data that compares "equal".  Thus,
   when the ENTRY value is a simple scalar, you must use
   hash_insert_if_absent.  ENTRY must not be NULL.  *//* This function is defined by module 'xhash'.  *//* Same as hash_insert, but invokes xalloc_die on memory exhaustion.  *//* If ENTRY matches an entry already in the hash table, return the pointer
   to the entry from the table.  Otherwise, insert ENTRY and return ENTRY.
   Return NULL if the storage required for insertion cannot be allocated.
   This implementation does not support duplicate entries or insertion of
   NULL.  *//* For an already existing hash table, change the number of buckets through
   specifying CANDIDATE.  The contents of the hash table are preserved.  The
   new number of buckets is automatically selected so as to _guarantee_ that
   the table may receive at least CANDIDATE different user entries, including
   those already in the table, before any other growth of the hash table size
   occurs.  If TUNING->IS_N_BUCKETS is true, then CANDIDATE specifies the
   exact number of buckets desired.  Return true iff the rehash succeeded.  *//*
 * Insertion and deletion.
 *//* Make all buckets empty, placing any chained entries on the free list.
   Apply the user-specified function data_freer (if any) to the datas of any
   affected entries.  *//* Same as hash_initialize, but invokes xalloc_die on memory exhaustion.  *//* Allocate and return a new hash table, or NULL upon failure.  The initial
   number of buckets is automatically selected so as to _guarantee_ that you
   may insert at least CANDIDATE different user entries before any growth of
   the hash table size occurs.  So, if have a reasonably tight a-priori upper
   bound on the number of entries you intend to insert in the hash table, you
   may save some table memory and insertion time, by specifying it here.  If
   the IS_N_BUCKETS field of the TUNING structure is true, the CANDIDATE
   argument has its meaning changed to the wanted number of buckets.

   TUNING points to a structure of user-supplied values, in case some fine
   tuning is wanted over the default behavior of the hasher.  If TUNING is
   NULL, the default tuning parameters are used instead.  If TUNING is
   provided but the values requested are out of bounds or might cause
   rounding errors, return NULL.

   The user-supplied HASHER function, when not NULL, accepts two
   arguments ENTRY and TABLE_SIZE.  It computes, by hashing ENTRY contents, a
   slot number for that entry which should be in the range 0..TABLE_SIZE-1.
   This slot number is then returned.

   The user-supplied COMPARATOR function, when not NULL, accepts two
   arguments pointing to user data, it then returns true for a pair of entries
   that compare equal, or false otherwise.  This function is internally called
   on entries which are already known to hash to the same bucket index,
   but which are distinct pointers.

   The user-supplied DATA_FREER function, when not NULL, may be later called
   with the user data as an argument, just before the entry containing the
   data gets freed.  This happens from within 'hash_free' or 'hash_clear'.
   You should specify this function only if you want these functions to free
   all of your 'data' data.  This is typically the case when your data is
   simply an auxiliary struct that you have malloc'd to aggregate several
   values.  *//* Reclaim all storage associated with a hash table.  If a data_freer
   function has been supplied by the user when the hash table was created,
   this function applies it to the data of each entry before freeing that
   entry.  *//* Return a hash index for a NUL-terminated STRING between 0 and N_BUCKETS-1.
   This is a convenience routine for constructing other hashing functions.  *//*
 * Allocation and clean-up.
 *//* Call a PROCESSOR function for each entry of a hash table, and return the
   number of entries for which the processor function returned success.  A
   pointer to some PROCESSOR_DATA which will be made available to each call to
   the processor function.  The PROCESSOR accepts two arguments: the first is
   the user entry being walked into, the second is the value of PROCESSOR_DATA
   as received.  The walking continue for as long as the PROCESSOR function
   returns nonzero.  When it returns zero, the walking is interrupted.  *//* Fill BUFFER with pointers to active user entries in the hash table, then
   return the number of pointers copied.  Do not copy more than BUFFER_SIZE
   pointers.  *//* Return the user data for the entry following ENTRY, where ENTRY has been
   returned by a previous call to either 'hash_get_first' or 'hash_get_next'.
   Return NULL if there are no more entries.  *//* Return the first data in the table, or NULL if the table is empty.  *//* The functions in this page traverse the hash table and process the
   contained entries.  For the traversal to work properly, the hash table
   should not be resized nor modified while any particular entry is being

   may be removed only if there is no shrink threshold and the entry being
   removed has already been passed to hash_get_next.  *//*

   section "Maximum Path Length Limitation",

   explains that the maximum size of a filename, including the terminating
   NUL byte, is 260 = 3 + 256 + 1.
   This is the same value as
     - FILENAME_MAX in <stdio.h>,

   *not* including the terminating NUL byte, and is set to 1023.
   Additionally, when _XOPEN_SOURCE is defined to 500 or more, PATH_MAX is
   not defined at all any more.  *//* POSIX:2008 defines PATH_MAX to be the maximum number of bytes in a filename,

   This file does *not* define PATH_MAX always.  Programs that use this file
   can handle the GNU/Hurd case in several ways:

   'assume (R)' is a directive from the programmer telling the
   compiler that R is true so the compiler needn't generate code to
   test R.  This is why 'assume' is in verify.h: it's related to
   static checking (in this case, static checking done by the
   programmer), not dynamic checking.

   'assume (R)' can affect compilation of all the code, not just code
   that happens to be executed after the assume (R) is "executed".
   For example, if the code mistakenly does 'assert (R); assume (R);'
   the compiler is entitled to optimize away the 'assert (R)'.

   Although assuming R can help a compiler generate better code or
   diagnostics, performance can suffer if R uses hard-to-optimize
   features such as function calls not inlined by the compiler.

   expression E.  *//* Each of these macros verifies that its argument R is nonzero.  To
   be portable, R should be an integer constant expression.  Unlike
   assert (R), there is no run-time overhead.

   There are two macros, since no single macro can be used in all
   contexts in C.  verify_expr (R, E) is for scalar contexts, including
   integer constant expression contexts.  verify (R) is for declaration
   contexts, e.g., the top level.  *//* @assert.h omit start@  *//* C11 requires this #define. *//* MSVC 14 in C++ mode supports the two-arguments static_assert but not
   the one-argument static_assert, and it does not support _Static_assert.
   We have to play preprocessor tricks to distinguish the two cases.
   Since the MSVC preprocessor is not ISO C compliant (cf.
   <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5134523/>), the solution is specific
   to MSVC.  *//* _GL_STATIC_ASSERT_H is defined if this code is copied into assert.h.  *//* Verify requirement R at compile-time, as a declaration without a
   trailing ';'.  If R is false, fail at compile-time.

   This macro requires three or more arguments but uses at most the first
   two, so that the _Static_assert macro optionally defined below supports
   both the C11 two-argument syntax and the C23 one-argument syntax.

   Unfortunately, unlike C11, this implementation must appear as an
   ordinary declaration, and cannot appear inside struct { ... }.  *//* Verify requirement R at compile-time, as an integer constant expression
   that returns 1.  If R is false, fail at compile-time, preferably
   with a diagnostic that includes the string-literal DIAGNOSTIC.  *//* Generate a symbol with the given prefix, making it unique if
   possible.  *//* _GL_COUNTER is an integer, preferably one that changes each time we
   use it.  Use __COUNTER__ if it works, falling back on __LINE__
   otherwise.  __LINE__ isn't perfect, but it's better than a
   constant.  *//* Concatenate two preprocessor tokens.  *//* Each of these macros verifies that its argument R is nonzero.  To
   be portable, R should be an integer constant expression.  Unlike
   assert (R), there is no run-time overhead.

   If _Static_assert works, verify (R) uses it directly.  Similarly,
   _GL_VERIFY_TRUE works by packaging a _Static_assert inside a struct
   that is an operand of sizeof.

   The code below uses several ideas for C++ compilers, and for C
   compilers that do not support _Static_assert:

   * The first step is ((R) ? 1 : -1).  Given an expression R, of
     integral or boolean or floating-point type, this yields an
     expression of integral type, whose value is later verified to be
     constant and nonnegative.

   * Next this expression W is wrapped in a type
     struct _gl_verify_type {
       unsigned int _gl_verify_error_if_negative: W;
     }.
     If W is negative, this yields a compile-time error.  No compiler can
     deal with a bit-field of negative size.

     One might think that an array size check would have the same
     effect, that is, that the type struct { unsigned int dummy[W]; }
     would work as well.  However, inside a function, some compilers
     (such as C++ compilers and GNU C) allow local parameters and
     variables inside array size expressions.  With these compilers,
     an array size check would not properly diagnose this misuse of
     the verify macro:

       void function (int n) { verify (n < 0); }

   * For the verify macro, the struct _gl_verify_type will need to
     somehow be embedded into a declaration.  To be portable, this
     declaration must declare an object, a constant, a function, or a
     typedef name.  If the declared entity uses the type directly,
     such as in

       struct dummy {...};
       typedef struct {...} dummy;
       extern struct {...} *dummy;
       extern void dummy (struct {...} *);
       extern struct {...} *dummy (void);

     two uses of the verify macro would yield colliding declarations
     if the entity names are not disambiguated.  A workaround is to
     attach the current line number to the entity name:

       #define _GL_CONCAT0(x, y) x##y
       #define _GL_CONCAT(x, y) _GL_CONCAT0 (x, y)
       extern struct {...} * _GL_CONCAT (dummy, __LINE__);

     But this has the problem that two invocations of verify from
     within the same macro would collide, since the __LINE__ value
     would be the same for both invocations.  (The GCC __COUNTER__
     macro solves this problem, but is not portable.)

     A solution is to use the sizeof operator.  It yields a number,
     getting rid of the identity of the type.  Declarations like

       extern int dummy [sizeof (struct {...})];
       extern void dummy (int [sizeof (struct {...})]);
       extern int (*dummy (void)) [sizeof (struct {...})];

     can be repeated.

   * Should the implementation use a named struct or an unnamed struct?
     Which of the following alternatives can be used?

       extern int dummy [sizeof (struct {...})];
       extern int dummy [sizeof (struct _gl_verify_type {...})];
       extern void dummy (int [sizeof (struct {...})]);
       extern void dummy (int [sizeof (struct _gl_verify_type {...})]);
       extern int (*dummy (void)) [sizeof (struct {...})];
       extern int (*dummy (void)) [sizeof (struct _gl_verify_type {...})];

     In the second and sixth case, the struct type is exported to the
     outer scope; two such declarations therefore collide.  GCC warns
     about the first, third, and fourth cases.  So the only remaining
     possibility is the fifth case:

       extern int (*dummy (void)) [sizeof (struct {...})];

   * GCC warns about duplicate declarations of the dummy function if
     -Wredundant-decls is used.  GCC 4.3 and later have a builtin
     __COUNTER__ macro that can let us generate unique identifiers for
     each dummy function, to suppress this warning.

   * This implementation exploits the fact that older versions of GCC,
     which do not support _Static_assert, also do not warn about the
     last declaration mentioned above.

   * GCC warns if -Wnested-externs is enabled and 'verify' is used
     within a function body; but inside a function, you can always
     arrange to use verify_expr instead.

   * In C++, any struct definition inside sizeof is invalid.
     Use a template type to work around the problem.  *//* FreeBSD 9.1 <sys/cdefs.h>, included by <stddef.h> and lots of other
   system headers, defines a conflicting _Static_assert that is no
   better than ours; override it.  *//* Define _GL_HAVE__STATIC_ASSERT to 1 if _Static_assert (R, DIAGNOSTIC)
   works as per C11.  This is supported by GCC 4.6.0+ and by clang 4+.

   Define _GL_HAVE__STATIC_ASSERT1 to 1 if _Static_assert (R) works as
   per C23.  This is supported by GCC 9.1+.

   Support compilers claiming conformance to the relevant standard,
   and also support GCC when not pedantic.  If we were willing to slow
   'configure' down we could also use it with other compilers, but
   since this affects only the quality of diagnostics, why bother?  *//* Compile-time assert-like macros.

   Why?  We need a data structure that

     1) Can contain an arbitrary number of 'char *' values.  The strings
        are compared via strcmp, not pointer comparison.
     2) Has insertion and deletion operations that are fast: ideally O(1),
        or possibly O(log n).  This is important for GNU sort, which may
        create a large number of temporary files.
     3) Allows iteration through all elements from within a signal handler.
     4) May or may not allow duplicates.  It doesn't matter here, since
        any file or subdir can only be removed once.

   Criterion 1) would allow any gl_list_t or gl_oset_t implementation.

   Criterion 2) leaves only GL_LINKEDHASH_LIST, GL_TREEHASH_LIST, or
   GL_TREE_OSET.

   Criterion 3) puts at disadvantage GL_TREEHASH_LIST and GL_TREE_OSET.
   Namely, iteration through the elements of a binary tree requires access
   to many ->left, ->right, ->parent pointers. However, the rebalancing
   code for insertion and deletion in an AVL or red-black tree is so
   complicated that we cannot assume that >left, ->right, ->parent pointers
   are in a consistent state throughout these operations.  Therefore, to
   avoid a crash in the signal handler, all destructive operations to the
   lists would have to be protected by a
       block_fatal_signals ();
       ...
       unblock_fatal_signals ();
   pair.  Which causes extra system calls.

   Criterion 3) would also discourage GL_ARRAY_LIST and GL_CARRAY_LIST,
   if they were not already excluded.  Namely, these implementations use
   xrealloc(), leaving a time window in which in the list->elements pointer
   points to already deallocated memory.  To avoid a crash in the signal
   handler at such a moment, all destructive operations would have to
   protected by block/unblock_fatal_signals (), in this case too.

   A list of type GL_LINKEDHASH_LIST without duplicates fulfills all
   requirements:
     2) Insertion and deletion are O(1) on average.
     3) The gl_list_iterator, gl_list_iterator_next implementations do
        not trigger memory allocations, nor other system calls, and are
        therefore safe to be called from a signal handler.
        Furthermore, since SIGNAL_SAFE_LIST is defined, the implementation
        of the destructive functions ensures that the list structure is
        safe to be traversed at any moment, even when interrupted by an
        asynchronous signal.

   Should be called before the file ABSOLUTE_FILE_NAME is created.  *//* Create a temporary directory.
   PREFIX is used as a prefix for the name of the temporary directory. It
   should be short and still give an indication about the program.
   PARENTDIR can be used to specify the parent directory; if NULL, a default
   parent directory is used (either $TMPDIR or /tmp or similar).
   CLEANUP_VERBOSE determines whether errors during explicit cleanup are
   reported to standard error.
   Return a fresh 'struct temp_dir' on success.  Upon error, an error message
   is shown and NULL is returned.  *//* Remove all registered files and subdirectories inside DIR and DIR itself.
   DIR cannot be used any more after this call.
   Return 0 upon success, or -1 if there was some problem.  *//* More fields are present here, but not public.  *//* Whether errors during explicit cleanup are reported to standard error.  *//* The absolute pathname of the directory.  *//* ========= Temporary directories and temporary files inside them ========= *//* Temporary directories and temporary files should be automatically removed
   when the program exits either normally or through a fatal signal.  We can't
   rely on the "unlink before close" idiom, because it works only on Unix and
   also - if no signal blocking is used - leaves a time window where a fatal
   signal would not clean up the temporary file.

   Also, open file descriptors need to be closed before the temporary files
   and the temporary directories can be removed, because only on Unix
   (excluding Cygwin) can one remove directories containing open files.

   There are two modules:
     - 'clean-temp' provides support for temporary directories and temporary
       files inside these temporary directories,
     - 'clean-temp-simple' provides support for temporary files without
       temporary directories.
   The temporary directories and files are automatically cleaned up (at the
   latest) when the program exits or dies from a fatal signal such as SIGINT,
   SIGTERM, SIGHUP, but not if it dies from a fatal signal such as SIGQUIT,
   SIGKILL, or SIGABRT, SIGSEGV, SIGBUS, SIGILL, SIGFPE.

   For the cleanup in the normal case, programs that use this module need to
   call 'cleanup_temp_dir' for each successful return of 'create_temp_dir'.
   The cleanup in the case of a fatal signal such as SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGHUP,
   is done entirely automatically by the functions of this module.

   Limitations: Files or directories can still be left over if
     - the program is dies from a fatal signal such as SIGQUIT, SIGKILL, or
       SIGABRT, SIGSEGV, SIGBUS, SIGILL, SIGFPE, or
     - in a multithreaded program, the fatal signal handler is already running
       while another thread of the program creates a new temporary directory
       or temporary file, or
     - on native Windows, some temporary files are used by a subprocess while
       the fatal signal interrupts the program.
 *//* Temporary directories and temporary files with automatic cleanup.

   There are several implementations of this list datatype, optimized for
   different operations or for memory.  You can start using the simplest list
   implementation, GL_ARRAY_LIST, and switch to a different implementation
   later, when you realize which operations are performed the most frequently.
   The API of the different implementations is exactly the same; when
   switching to a different implementation, you only have to change the
   gl_list_create call.

   The implementations are:
     GL_ARRAY_LIST        a growable array
     GL_CARRAY_LIST       a growable circular array
     GL_LINKED_LIST       a linked list
     GL_AVLTREE_LIST      a binary tree (AVL tree)
     GL_RBTREE_LIST       a binary tree (red-black tree)
     GL_LINKEDHASH_LIST   a hash table with a linked list
     GL_AVLTREEHASH_LIST  a hash table with a binary tree (AVL tree)
     GL_RBTREEHASH_LIST   a hash table with a binary tree (red-black tree)

   The memory consumption is asymptotically the same: O(1) for every object
   in the list.  When looking more closely at the average memory consumed
   for an object, GL_ARRAY_LIST is the most compact representation, and
   GL_LINKEDHASH_LIST and GL_TREEHASH_LIST need more memory.

   The guaranteed average performance of the operations is, for a list of
   n elements:

   Operation                  ARRAY    LINKED    TREE    LINKEDHASH   TREEHASH
                              CARRAY                   with|without with|without

   The signals will be blocked (= delayed) until the next call to
   unblock_fatal_signals().  If the signals are already blocked, a further
   call to block_fatal_signals() has no effect.  *//* Sometimes it is necessary to block the usually fatal signals while the
   data structures being accessed by the cleanup action are being built or
   reorganized.  This is the case, for example, when a temporary file or
   directory is created through mkstemp() or mkdtemp(), because these
   functions create the temporary file or directory _before_ returning its
   name to the application.  *//* Register a cleanup function to be executed when a catchable fatal signal
   occurs.

   Restrictions for the cleanup function:
     - The cleanup function can do all kinds of system calls.  It may also
       modify (clobber) errno.
     - It can also access application dependent memory locations and data
       structures provided they are in a consistent state. One way to ensure
       this is through block_fatal_signals()/unblock_fatal_signals(), see
       below.  Another - more tricky - way to ensure this is the careful use
       of 'volatile'.
   However,
     - malloc() and similarly complex facilities are not safe to be called
       because they are not guaranteed to be in a consistent state.
     - Also, the cleanup function must not block the catchable fatal signals
       and leave them blocked upon return.

   The cleanup function is executed asynchronously.  It is unspecified
   whether during its execution the catchable fatal signals are blocked
   or not.

   Return 0 upon success, or -1 if there was a memory allocation problem.  *//* It is often useful to do some cleanup action when a usually fatal signal
   terminates the process, like removing a temporary file or killing a
   subprocess that may be stuck waiting for a device, pipe or network input.
   Such signals are SIGHUP, SIGINT, SIGPIPE, SIGTERM, and possibly others.
   The limitation of this facility is that it cannot work for SIGKILL.

   Signals with a SIG_IGN handler are considered to be non-fatal.  The
   functions in this file assume that when a SIG_IGN handler is installed
   for a signal, it was installed before any functions in this file were
   called and it stays so for the whole lifetime of the process.  *//* Emergency actions in case of a fatal signal.

         the return value of the final fclose() call.

   The benefit of (a) is that non file related errors (such that ENOMEM during
   fprintf) and temporary error conditions can be diagnosed accurately.

   A theoretical benefit of (a) is also that, on POSIX systems, in the case of
   an ENOSPC error, errno is set and can be used by error() to provide a more
   accurate error message. But in practice, this benefit is not big because
   users can easily figure out by themselves why a file cannot be written to,
   and furthermore the function fwriteerror() can provide errno as well.

   The big drawback of (a) is extensive error checking code: Every function
   which does stream output must return an error indicator.

   This file provides support for (b).  *//* Detect write error on a stream.

 *    more bytes than the subprocess can handle at once, the subprocess
 *    may write its data and wait on you to read it, but you are currently
 *    busy writing.
 * 2) When you don't know ahead of time how many bytes the subprocess
 *    will produce, the usual technique of calling read (fd, buf, BUFSIZ)
 *    with a fixed BUFSIZ will, on Linux 2.2.17 and on BSD systems, cause
 *    the read() call to block until *all* of the buffer has been filled.

 *//* All these functions create a subprocess and don't wait for its termination.
   They return the process id of the subprocess.  They also return in fd[]
   one or two file descriptors for communication with the subprocess.
   If the subprocess creation fails: if exit_on_error is true, the main
   process exits with an error message; otherwise, an error message is given
   if null_stderr is false, then -1 is returned, with errno set, and fd[]
   remain uninitialized.

   After finishing communication, the caller should call wait_subprocess()
   to get rid of the subprocess in the process table.

   progname is the name of the program to be executed by the subprocess, used
   for error messages.
   prog_path is the file name of the program to be executed by the subprocess.
   If it contains no slashes, a search is conducted in $PATH.  An operating
   system dependent suffix is added, if necessary.
   prog_argv is the array of strings that the subprocess shall receive in
   argv[].  It is a NULL-terminated array.  prog_argv[0] should normally be
   identical to prog_path.

   If directory is not NULL, the subprocess is started in that directory.  If
   prog_path is a relative file name, it resolved before changing to that
   directory.  The current directory of the current process remains unchanged.

   If slave_process is true, the child process will be terminated when its
   creator receives a catchable fatal signal or exits normally.  If
   slave_process is false, the child process will continue running in this
   case, until it is lucky enough to attempt to communicate with its creator
   and thus get a SIGPIPE signal.

   If exit_on_error is false, a child process id of -1 should be treated the
   same way as a subprocess which accepts no input, produces no output and
   terminates with exit code 127.  Why?  Some errors during posix_spawnp()
   cause the function posix_spawnp() to return an error code; some other
   errors cause the subprocess to exit with return code 127.  It is
   implementation dependent which error is reported which way.  The caller
   must treat both cases as equivalent.

   It is recommended that no signal is blocked or ignored (i.e. have a
   signal handler with value SIG_IGN) while any of these functions is called.
   The reason is that child processes inherit the mask of blocked signals
   from their parent (both through posix_spawn() and fork()/exec());
   likewise, signals ignored in the parent are also ignored in the child
   (except possibly for SIGCHLD).  And POSIX:2001 says [in the description
   of exec()]:
       "it should be noted that many existing applications wrongly
        assume that they start with certain signals set to the default
        action and/or unblocked. In particular, applications written
        with a simpler signal model that does not include blocking of
        signals, such as the one in the ISO C standard, may not behave
        properly if invoked with some signals blocked. Therefore, it is
        best not to block or ignore signals across execs without explicit
        reason to do so, and especially not to block signals across execs
        of arbitrary (not closely co-operating) programs."  *//* Get pid_t.  *//* Creation of subprocesses, communicating via pipes.

   Arguments:
   - child is the pid of the subprocess.
   - progname is the name of the program executed by the subprocess, used for
     error messages.
   - If ignore_sigpipe is true, consider a subprocess termination due to
     SIGPIPE as equivalent to a success.  This is suitable for processes whose
     only purpose is to write to standard output.  This flag can be safely set
     to false when the process' standard output is known to go to DEV_NULL.
   - If null_stderr is true, the usual error message to stderr will be omitted.
     This is suitable when the subprocess does not fulfill an important task.
   - slave_process should be set to true if the process has been launched as a
     slave process.
   - If exit_on_error is true, any error will cause the main process to exit

   - If termsigp is not NULL: *termsig will be set to the signal that

   With Mono, the MONO_PATH is a colon separated list of pathnames. (On
   Windows: semicolon separated list of pathnames.)

   We try the CIL interpreters in the following order:
     1. "mono", because it is a partially free system but doesn't integrate
        well with Unix.
     2. "clix", although it is not free, because it is a kind of "reference
        implementation" of C#.
   But the order can be changed through the --enable-csharp configuration
   option.

   The PATH argument consists of a list of directories, separated by ':' or
   (on native Windows) by ';'.  An empty PATH element designates the current
   directory.  A null PATH is equivalent to an empty PATH, that is, to the
   singleton list that contains only the current directory.

   If DIRECTORY is not NULL, all relative filenames (i.e. PROGNAME when it
   contains a slash, and the PATH elements) are considered relative to
   DIRECTORY instead of relative to the current directory of this process.

   Determines the pathname that would be called by execlp/execvp of PROGNAME.
   - If successful, it returns a pathname containing a slash (either absolute
     or relative to the current directory).  The returned string can be used
     with either execl/execv or execlp/execvp.  It is freshly malloc()ed if it
     is != PROGNAME.
   - Otherwise, it sets errno and returns NULL.
     Specific errno values include:
       - ENOENT: means that the program's file was not found.
       - EACCES: means that the program's file cannot be accessed (due to some
         issue with one of the ancestor directories) or lacks the execute
         permissions.
       - ENOMEM: means out of memory.
   If OPTIMIZE_FOR_EXEC is true, the function saves some work, under the
   assumption that the resulting pathname will not be accessed directly,
   only through execl/execv or execlp/execvp.

   Here, a "slash" means:
     - On POSIX systems excluding Cygwin: a '/',
     - On Windows, OS/2, DOS platforms: a '/' or '\'. *//* Looks up a program in the PATH.
   Attempts to determine the pathname that would be called by execlp/execvp
   of PROGNAME.  If successful, it returns a pathname containing a slash
   (either absolute or relative to the current directory).  Otherwise, it
   returns PROGNAME unmodified.
   Because of the latter case, callers should use execlp/execvp, not
   execl/execv on the returned pathname.
   The returned string is freshly malloc()ed if it is != PROGNAME.  *//* Locating a program in PATH.

     posix_spawnp() to return an error code; some other errors cause the
     subprocess to exit with return code 127.  It is implementation
     dependent which error is reported which way.  We treat both cases as
     equivalent.  *//* Treat failure and signalled child processes like wait_subprocess()
     does.  *//* prog is not a native executable.  Try to execute it as a
             shell script.  Note that prepare_spawn() has already prepended
             a hidden element "sh.exe" to argv.  *//* Executing arbitrary files as shell scripts is unsecure.  *//* Pass the environment explicitly.  This is needed if the program has
       modified the environment using putenv() or [un]setenv().  On Windows,
       processes have two environments, one in the "environment block" of the
       process and managed through SetEnvironmentVariable(), and one inside the
       process, in the location retrieved by the 'environ' macro.  If we were
       to pass NULL, the child process would inherit a copy of the environment
       block - ignoring the effects of putenv() and [un]setenv().  *//* Create standard file handles of child process.  *//* If a change of directory is requested, make sure PROG_PATH is absolute
         before we do so.  This is needed because
           - posix_spawn and posix_spawnp are required to resolve a relative
             PROG_PATH *after* changing the directory.  See
             <https://www.austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=1208>:

                process _after_ all file_actions have been performed."
             But this would be a surprising application behaviour, possibly
             even security relevant.
           - For the Windows CreateProcess() function, it is unspecified whether
             a relative file name is interpreted to the parent's current
             directory or to the specified directory.  See
             <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createprocessa>  *//* avoid warning on VMS *//* avoid warning related to gnulib module unistd *//* EINTR handling for close(), open().
   These functions can return -1/EINTR even though we don't have any
   signal handlers set up, namely when we get interrupted via SIGSTOP.  *//* Choice of implementation for native Windows.
   - Define to 0 to use the posix_spawn facility (modules 'posix_spawn' and
     'posix_spawnp'), that is based on the module 'windows-spawn'.

     directly.

     is ignored if sa_sigaction (after casting) equals SIG_IGN.  In

   The subsequence of vector 0 is [XOFF, XLIM) and likewise for vector 1.

   Note that XLIM, YLIM are exclusive bounds.  All indices into the vectors
   are origin-0.

   If FIND_MINIMAL, find a minimal difference no matter how
   expensive it is.

   The results are recorded by invoking NOTE_DELETE and NOTE_INSERT.

   Scan from the beginnings of the vectors, and simultaneously from the ends,
   doing a breadth-first search through the space of edit-sequence.
   When the two searches meet, we have found the midpoint of the shortest
   edit sequence.

   If FIND_MINIMAL is true, find the minimal edit script regardless of
   expense.  Otherwise, if the search is too expensive, use heuristics to
   stop the search and report a suboptimal answer.

   Set PART->(xmid,ymid) to the midpoint (XMID,YMID).  The diagonal number
   XMID - YMID equals the number of inserted elements minus the number
   of deleted elements (counting only elements before the midpoint).

   Set PART->lo_minimal to true iff the minimal edit script for the
   left half of the partition is known; similarly for PART->hi_minimal.

   This function assumes that the first elements of the specified portions
   of the two vectors do not match, and likewise that the last elements do not
   match.  The caller must trim matching elements from the beginning and end
   of the portions it is going to specify.

   If we return the "wrong" partitions, the worst this can do is cause
   suboptimal diff output.  It cannot cause incorrect diff output.  *//* Likewise for high half.  *//* True if low half will be analyzed minimally.  *//* Midpoints of this partition.  *//* Snakes bigger than this are considered "big".  *//* Edit scripts longer than this are too expensive to compute.  *//* This corresponds to the diff --speed-large-files flag.

     OFFSET                  A signed integer type sufficient to hold the

                             something like ptrdiff_t.
     EXTRA_CONTEXT_FIELDS    Declarations of fields for 'struct context'.
     NOTE_DELETE(ctxt, xoff) Record the removal of the object xvec[xoff].
     NOTE_INSERT(ctxt, yoff) Record the insertion of the object yvec[yoff].
     NOTE_ORDERED            (Optional) A boolean expression saying that
                             NOTE_DELETE and NOTE_INSERT calls must be
                             issued in offset order.
     EARLY_ABORT(ctxt)       (Optional) A boolean expression that triggers an
                             early abort of the computation.
     USE_HEURISTIC           (Optional) Define if you want to support the
                             heuristic for large vectors.

   It is also possible to use this file with abstract arrays.  In this case,
   xvec and yvec are not represented in memory.  They only exist conceptually.
   In this case, the list of defines above is amended as follows:
     ELEMENT                 Undefined.
     EQUAL                   Undefined.
     XVECREF_YVECREF_EQUAL(ctxt, xoff, yoff)
                             A three-argument macro: References xvec[xoff] and
                             yvec[yoff] and tests these elements for equality.

   Before including this file, you also need to include:
     #include <limits.h>
     #include "minmax.h"
 *//* The basic idea is to consider two vectors as similar if, when
   transforming the first vector into the second vector through a
   sequence of edits (inserts and deletes of one element each),
   this sequence is short - or equivalently, if the ordered list
   of elements that are untouched by these edits is long.  For a
   good introduction to the subject, read about the "Levenshtein
   distance" in Wikipedia.

   The basic algorithm is described in:
   "An O(ND) Difference Algorithm and its Variations", Eugene W. Myers,
   Algorithmica Vol. 1, 1986, pp. 251-266,
   <https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01840446>.
   See especially section 4.2, which describes the variation used below.

   The basic algorithm was independently discovered as described in:
   "Algorithms for Approximate String Matching", Esko Ukkonen,
   Information and Control Vol. 64, 1985, pp. 100-118,
   <https://doi.org/10.1016/S0019-9958(85)80046-2>.

   Unless the 'find_minimal' flag is set, this code uses the TOO_EXPENSIVE
   heuristic, by Paul Eggert, to limit the cost to O(N**1.5 log N)
   at the price of producing suboptimal output for large inputs with
   many differences.  *//* Analyze differences between two vectors.

         to be preserved.  *//* Need more memory.  *//* Allocate memory for fdiag and bdiag from a thread-local pool.  *//* Set TOO_EXPENSIVE to be approximate square root of input size,
     bounded below by 4096.  *//* set the info for each string.  *//* Return an arbitrary value < LOWER_BOUND.  *//* Prob: 66% *//* Sum up the absolute values.  *//* Subtract the occurrence counts in Y.  *//* Determine the occurrence counts in X.  *//* array C -> OCC(X,C) - OCC(Y,C) *//* Compute a less quick upper bound.
             Each edit is an insertion or deletion of a character, hence
             modifies the occurrence count of a character by 1 and leaves the
             other occurrence counts unchanged.
             Therefore, when starting from a sequence X and ending at a
             sequence Y, and denoting the occurrence count of C in X with
             OCC (X, C), with N edits,
               sum_C | OCC (X, C) - OCC (Y, C) | <= N.
             (Proof by induction over N.)
             So, at the end, we will have
               edit_count >= sum_C | OCC (X, C) - OCC (Y, C) |,
             and hence
               result
                 = (xvec_length + yvec_length - edit_count)
                   / (xvec_length + yvec_length)
                 <= (xvec_length + yvec_length - sum_C | OCC(X,C) - OCC(Y,C) |)
                    / (xvec_length + yvec_length).
           *//* Prob: 99% *//* When X and Y are both small, avoid the overhead of setting up an
         array of size 256.  *//* Prob: 74% *//* Compute a quick upper bound.
         Each edit is an insertion or deletion of an element, hence modifies
         the length of the sequence by at most 1.
         Therefore, when starting from a sequence X and ending at a sequence Y,
         with N edits,  | yvec_length - xvec_length | <= N.  (Proof by
         induction over N.)
         So, at the end, we will have
           edit_count >= | xvec_length - yvec_length |.
         and hence
           result
             = (xvec_length + yvec_length - edit_count)
               / (xvec_length + yvec_length)
             <= (xvec_length + yvec_length - | yvec_length - xvec_length |)
                / (xvec_length + yvec_length)
             = 2 * min (xvec_length, yvec_length) / (xvec_length + yvec_length).
       *//* Prob: 1% *//* short-circuit obvious comparisons *//* In the code below, branch probabilities were measured by Ralf Wildenhues,
   by running "msgmerge LL.po coreutils.pot" with msgmerge 0.18 for many
   values of LL.  The probability indicates that the condition evaluates
   to true; whether that leads to a branch or a non-branch in the code,
   depends on the compiler's reordering of basic blocks.  *//* Ensure that keys_init is called once only.  *//* The per-thread initial values are NULL and 0, respectively.  *//* TLS key for a 'uintptr_t' *//* TLS key for a 'ptrdiff_t *' *//* Because fstrcmp is typically called multiple times, attempt to minimize

   To make it multithread-safe, without need for a lock that protects the
   already allocated memory, store the allocated memory per thread.  Free
   it only when the thread exits.  *//* We don't need USE_HEURISTIC, since it is unlikely in typical uses of

     the table size and rehash.  There's no point in checking the number of
     entries:  if the hashing function is ill-conditioned, rehashing is not
     likely to improve it.  *//* If there's a matching entry already in the table, return that.  *//* The caller cannot insert a NULL entry, since hash_lookup returns NULL
     to indicate "not found", and hash_find_entry uses "bucket->data == NULL"
     to indicate an empty bucket.  *//* table->n_entries already holds its value.  *//* We've allocated new_table->bucket (and possibly some entries),
     exhausted the free list, and moved some but not all entries into
     new_table.  We must undo the partial move before returning
     failure.  The only way to get into this situation is if new_table
     uses fewer buckets than the old table, so we will reclaim some
     free entries as overflows in the new table are put back into
     distinct buckets in the old table.

     There are some pathological cases where a single pass through the
     table requires more intermediate overflow entries than using two
     passes.  Two passes give worse cache performance and takes
     longer, but at this point, we're already out of memory, so slow
     and safe is better than failure.  *//* table->n_entries and table->entry_stack already hold their value.  *//* Entries transferred successfully; tie up the loose ends.  *//* Merely reuse the extra old space into the new table.  *//* In order for the transfer to successfully complete, we need
     additional overflow entries when distinct buckets in the old
     table collide into a common bucket in the new table.  The worst
     case possible is a hasher that gives a good spread with the old
     size, but returns a constant with the new size; if we were to
     guarantee table->n_buckets_used-1 free entries in advance, then
     the transfer would be guaranteed to not allocate memory.
     However, for large tables, a guarantee of no further allocation
     introduces a lot of extra memory pressure, all for an unlikely
     corner case (most rehashes reduce, rather than increase, the
     number of overflow entries needed).  So, we instead ensure that
     the transfer process can be reversed if we hit a memory
     allocation failure mid-transfer.  *//* Move from one bucket header to another.  *//* Allocate or recycle an entry, when moving from a bucket
               header into a bucket overflow.  *//* Now move the bucket head.  Be sure that if we fail due to
           allocation failure that the src table is in a consistent
           state.  *//* Free an existing entry, when moving from a bucket

           then the bucket head, to minimize memory pressure.  After
           all, the only time we might allocate is when moving the
           bucket head, but moving overflow entries first may create
           free entries that can be recycled by the time we finally
           get to the bucket head.  *//* Internal helper, to move entries from SRC to DST.  Both tables must
   share the same free entry list.  If SAFE, only move overflow
   entries, saving bucket heads for later, so that no allocations will
   occur.  Return false if the free entry list is exhausted and an
   allocation fails.  *//* No entry found.  *//* Unlink the entry to delete, then save the freed entry for later

   ENTRY matches an entry in the table, return a pointer to the corresponding

   Otherwise, return NULL.  When DELETE is true and ENTRY matches an entry in
   the table, unlink the matching entry.  *//* Free a hash entry which was part of some bucket overflow,
   saving it for later recycling.  *//* Get a new hash entry for a bucket overflow, possibly by recycling a

         when the user gets some feedback about it.  Once the table is created,
         if the user provides invalid tuning options, we silently revert to

         options.  *//* Compute the size of the bucket array for the given CANDIDATE and
   TUNING, or return 0 if there is no possible way to allocate that

     rounding errors in size calculations do not cause allocations to
     fail to grow or shrink as they should.  The smallest allocation
     is 11 (due to next_prime's algorithm), so an epsilon of 0.1
     should be good enough.  *//* For the given hash TABLE, check the user supplied tuning structure for
   reasonable values, and return true if there is no gross error with it.
   Otherwise, definitively reset the TUNING field to some acceptable default
   in the hash table (that is, the user loses the right of further modifying
   tuning arguments), and return false.  *//* If the user passes a NULL comparator, we use pointer comparison.  *//* When hashing unique pointers, it is often the case that they were
     generated by malloc and thus have the property that the low-order
     bits are 0.  As this tends to give poorer performance with small
     tables, we rotate the pointer value before performing division,
     in an attempt to improve hash quality.  *//* If the user passes a NULL hasher, we hash the raw pointer.  *//* Make it definitely odd.  *//* Skip small primes.  *//* Round a given CANDIDATE number up to the nearest prime, and return that

   1.0).  The growth threshold defaults to 0.8, and the growth factor
   defaults to 1.414, meaning that the table will have doubled its size
   every second time 80% of the buckets get used.  *//* A hash table contains many internal entries, each holding a pointer to
   some user-provided data (also called a user entry).  An entry indistinctly
   refers to both the internal entry and its associated user entry.  A user
   entry contents may be hashed by a randomization function (the hashing
   function, or just "hasher" for short) into a number (or "slot") between 0
   and the current table size.  At each slot position in the hash table,
   starts a linked chain of entries for which the user data all hash to this
   slot.  A bucket is the collection of all entries hashing to the same slot.

   A good "hasher" function will distribute entries rather evenly in buckets.
   In the ideal case, the length of each bucket is roughly the number of
   entries divided by the table size.  Finding the slot for a data is usually
   done in constant time by the "hasher", and the later finding of a precise
   entry is linear in time with the size of the bucket.  Consequently, a
   larger hash table size (that is, a larger number of buckets) is prone to
   yielding shorter chains, *given* the "hasher" function behaves properly.

   Long buckets slow down the lookup algorithm.  One might use big hash table
   sizes in hope to reduce the average length of buckets, but this might
   become inordinate, as unused slots in the hash table take some space.  The
   best bet is to make sure you are using a good "hasher" function (beware
   that those are not that easy to write! :-), and to use a table size
   larger than the actual number of entries.  *//* Whenever obstacks are used, it is possible to allocate all overflowed
       entries into a single stack, so they all can be freed in a single
       operation.  It is not clear if the speedup is worth the trouble.  *//* A linked list of freed struct hash_entry structs.  *//* Three functions are given to 'hash_initialize', see the documentation
       block for this function.  In a word, HASHER randomizes a user entry
       into a number up from 0 up to some maximum minus 1; COMPARATOR returns
       true if two user entries compare equally; and DATA_FREER is the cleanup
       function for a user entry.  *//* Tuning arguments, kept in a physically separate structure.  *//* The array of buckets starts at BUCKET and extends to BUCKET_LIMIT-1,
       for a possibility of N_BUCKETS.  Among those, N_BUCKETS_USED buckets
       are not empty, there are N_ENTRIES active entries in the table.  *//* Define USE_OBSTACK to 1 if you want the allocator to use obstacks instead
   of malloc.  If you change USE_OBSTACK, you have to recompile!  *//* hash - hashing table processing.

   target_version can also be given as NULL. In this case, the required
   target_version is determined from the found JVM (see javaversion.h).
   Specifying target_version is useful when building a library (.jar) that is
   useful outside the given package. Passing target_version = NULL is useful
   when building an application.
   It is unreasonable to ask for:
     - target_version < 1.4 with source_version >= 1.4, or
     - target_version < 1.5 with source_version >= 1.5, or
     - target_version < 1.6 with source_version >= 1.6, or
     - target_version < 1.7 with source_version >= 1.7, or
     - target_version < 1.8 with source_version >= 1.8, or
     - target_version < 9 with source_version >= 9, or
     - target_version < 10 with source_version >= 10, or
     - target_version < 11 with source_version >= 11,
   because even Sun's/Oracle's javac doesn't support these combinations.
   It is redundant to ask for a target_version > source_version, since the
   smaller target_version = source_version will also always work and newer JVMs
   support the older target_versions too. Except for the cases
     - target_version = 1.4, source_version = 1.3, which allows gcj versions 3.0
       to 3.2 to be used,
     - target-version = 1.6, source-version = 1.5, which allows gcj versions
       >= 4.3 to be used.

   directory is the target directory. The .class file for class X.Y.Z is
   written at directory/X/Y/Z.class. If directory is NULL, the .class
   file is written in the source's directory.
   use_minimal_classpath = true means to ignore the user's CLASSPATH and
   use a minimal one. This is likely to reduce possible problems if the
   user's CLASSPATH contains garbage or a classes.zip file of the wrong
   Java version.
   If verbose, the command to be executed will be printed.
   Return false if OK, true on error.  *//* Compile a Java program.

   The CLASSPATH is a colon separated list of pathnames. (On Windows: a

   We try the Java compilers in the following order:
     1. getenv ("JAVAC"), because the user must be able to override our
        preferences,
     2. "gcj -C", because it is a completely free compiler,
     3. "javac", because it is a standard compiler,
     4. "jikes", comes last because it has some deviating interpretation
        of the Java Language Specification and because it requires a

   We unset the JAVA_HOME environment variable, because a wrong setting of
   this variable can confuse the JDK's javac.

   variable by default points to the internal function
   'print_and_abort'.  *//* Don't change any of these strings.  Yes, it would be possible to add

     at the end of an adjacent chunk.  *//* Suppress -Wmissing-prototypes warning.  We don't want to declare this in
   obstack.h because it is just for debugging.  *//* Return nonzero if object OBJ has been allocated from obstack H.
   This is here for debugging.
   If you use it in a program, you are probably losing.  *//* The new chunk certainly contains no empty object yet.  *//* If the object just copied was the only data in OLD_CHUNK,
     free that chunk and remove it from the chain.
     But not if that chunk might contain an empty object.  *//* Move the existing object to the new chunk.  *//* Compute an aligned object_base in the new chunk *//* Allocate and initialize the new chunk.  *//* Compute size for new chunk.  *//* Allocate a new current chunk for the obstack *H

   Copies any partial object from the end of the old chunk
   to the beginning of the new one.  *//* The initial chunk now contains no empty object.  *//* 12 is sizeof (mhead) and 4 is EXTRA from GNU malloc.
         Use the values for range checking, because if range checking is off,
         the extra bytes won't be missed terribly, but if range checking is on
         and we used a larger request, a whole extra 4096 bytes would be
         allocated.

         These number are irrelevant to the new GNU malloc.  I suspect it is
         less sensitive to the size of the request.  *//* Default size is what GNU malloc can fit in a 4096-byte block.  *//* points to new chunk *//* Initialize an obstack H for use.  Specify chunk size SIZE (0 means default).
   Objects start on multiples of ALIGNMENT (0 means use default).

   Return nonzero if successful, calls obstack_alloc_failed_handler if
   allocation fails.  *//* Call functions with either the traditional malloc/free calling
   interface, or the mmalloc/mfree interface (that adds an extra first
   argument), based on the value of use_extra_arg.  *//* If malloc were really smart, it would round addresses to DEFAULT_ALIGNMENT.
   But in fact it might be less smart and round addresses to as much as
   DEFAULT_ROUNDING.  So we prepare for it to do that.

   DEFAULT_ALIGNMENT cannot be an enum constant; see gnulib's alignof.h.  *//* Determine default alignment.  *//* If GCC, or if an oddball (testing?) host that #defines __alignof__,
   use the already-supplied __alignof__.  Otherwise, this must be Gnulib
   (as glibc assumes GCC); defer to Gnulib's alignof_type.  *//* Comment out all this code if we are using the GNU C Library, and are not
   actually compiling the library itself, and the installed library

   and linking in this code is a waste when using the GNU C library
   (especially if it is a shared library).  Rather than having every GNU
   program understand 'configure --with-gnu-libc' and omit the object
   files, it is simpler to just do this in the source for each such file.  *//* NOTE BEFORE MODIFYING THIS FILE: _OBSTACK_INTERFACE_VERSION in

   Note that the prepare_read/done_read functions may be called in a
   different thread than the current thread (depending on the platform).
   However, they will always be called before pipe_filter_gi_write has
   returned, or otherwise not sooner than the next call to
   pipe_filter_gi_write or pipe_filter_gi_close.

   Return only after all the entire buffer has been written to the pipe or

   Return 0 upon success, or (only if exit_on_error is false):
   - -1 with errno set upon failure,
   - the positive exit code of the subprocess if that failed.  *//* Create a subprocess and pipe some data through it.
   Arguments:
   - progname is the program name used in error messages.
   - prog_path is the file name of the program to invoke.
   - prog_argv is a NULL terminated argument list, starting with
     prog_path as first element.
   - If null_stderr is true, the subprocess' stderr will be redirected
     to /dev/null, and the usual error message to stderr will be
     omitted.  This is suitable when the subprocess does not fulfill an
     important task.
   - If exit_on_error is true, any error will cause the main process to
     exit with an error status.
   If the subprocess does not start correctly, exit if exit_on_error is
   true, otherwise return NULL and set errno.

   The caller will write to the subprocess through pipe_filter_gi_write
   and finally call pipe_filter_gi_close.  During such calls, the
   prepare_read and done_read function may be called to process any data
   that the subprocess has written.

   Note that the prepare_read/done_read functions may be called in a
   different thread than the current thread (depending on the platform).
   But they will not be called after the pipe_filter_gi_close function has
   returned.

   However, they will always be called before pipe_filter_gi_close has
   returned.

   The write side of the pipe is closed as soon as pipe_filter_gi_close
   starts, while the read side will be closed just before it finishes.

   Return 0 upon success, or (only if exit_on_error is false):

   Callback arguments are as described above.

   Data is alternately written to the subprocess, through the functions
   prepare_write and done_write, and read from the subprocess, through the
   functions prepare_read and done_read.

   Note that the prepare_write/done_write functions and the
   prepare_read/done_read functions may be called in different threads than
   the current thread (depending on the platform).  But they will not be
   called after the pipe_filter_ii_execute function has returned.

   - the positive exit code of the subprocess if that failed.  *//* ============================ pipe_filter_ii ============================ *//* These two functions together describe the side that reads data from the

   - prepare_read (&num_bytes, p) must return a pointer to a buffer for data
     that can be read and set num_bytes to the size of that buffer
     (must be > 0).
   - done_read (data_read, num_bytes_read, p) is called after num_bytes_read
     bytes were read into the buffer.
   Here p is always the private_data argument passed to the main function.  *//* These two functions together describe the side that writes data to the
   subprocess when it has the form of an iterator.
   - prepare_write (&num_bytes, p) must either return a pointer to data that
     is ready to be written and set num_bytes to the number of bytes ready to
     be written, or return NULL when no more bytes are to be written.
   - done_write (data_written, num_bytes_written) is called after
     num_bytes_written bytes were written.  It is guaranteed that
     num_bytes_written > 0.
   Here p is always the private_data argument passed to the main function.  *//* Piping data through a subprocess in the nave way - write data to the
   subprocess and read from the subprocess when you expect it to have
   produced results - is subject to two kinds of deadlocks:
   1) If you write more than PIPE_MAX bytes or, more generally, if you write
      more bytes than the subprocess can handle at once, the subprocess
      may write its data and wait on you to read it, but you are currently
      busy writing.
   2) When you don't know ahead of time how many bytes the subprocess
      will produce, the usual technique of calling read (fd, buf, BUFSIZ)
      with a fixed BUFSIZ will, on Linux 2.2.17 and on BSD systems, cause
      the read() call to block until *all* of the buffer has been filled.
      But the subprocess cannot produce more data until you gave it more
      input.  But you are currently busy reading from it.

   This header file declares four set of functions that pipes data through
   the subprocess, without risking these deadlocks.

   The side that writes data to the subprocess can be seen as a "generator",
   that is, as a subroutine that produces and writes a piece of data here and
   there, see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generator_(computer_science)>.
   But often, it can be written in the form of an "iterator", that is, as a
   function that, each time it is invoked, produces and writes one more piece
   of data.

   Similarly, the side that reads data from the subprocess can be seen as
   a "generator", that is, as a subroutine that consumes a piece of data here
   and there.  Often, it can be written in the form of an "iterator", that
   is, as a function that, each time it is invoked, consumes one more piece
   of data.

   This header file declares four set of functions:

                       |   writer   |   reader   |
       ----------------+------------+------------+
       pipe_filter_ii  |  iterator  |  iterator  |
       pipe_filter_ig  |  iterator  |  generator |
       pipe_filter_gi  |  generator |  iterator  |
       pipe_filter_gg  |  generator |  generator |
       ----------------+------------+------------+

   The last one uses threads in order to implement two generators running at
   the same time.  (For the relation between generators, coroutines, and
   threads, see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generator_(computer_science)>
   and <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine>.)  It is therefore only
   portable to platforms with kernel-based POSIX threads.  *//* Filtering of data through a subprocess.  -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

                   This happens actually on AIX and IRIX, when bufsize >= 8192
                   (even though PIPE_BUF and pathconf ("/", _PC_PIPE_BUF) are
                   both 32768).  *//* Attempt to write.  *//* How could select() return if none of the two descriptors is ready?  *//* Do EINTR handling here instead of in pipe-filter-aux.h,
           because select() cannot be referred to from an inline
           function on AIX 7.1.  *//* Enable non-blocking I/O.  This permits the read() and write() calls
       to return -1/EAGAIN without blocking; this is important for polling
       if HAVE_SELECT is not defined.  It also permits the read() and write()
       calls to return after partial reads/writes; this is important if
       HAVE_SELECT is defined, because select() only says that some data
       can be read or written, not how many.  Without non-blocking I/O,
       Linux 2.2.17 and BSD systems prefer to block instead of returning
       with partial results.  *//* All bits except fd[1] are always cleared.  *//* All bits except fd[0] are always cleared.  *//* When we write to the child process and it has just terminated,
     we don't want to die from a SIGPIPE signal.  So set the SIGPIPE

     Asynchronous I/O is also not suitable because it notifies the caller only
     about completion of the I/O request, not about intermediate progress.
     So do the writing and the reading in separate threads.  *//* Open a bidirectional pipe to a subprocess.  *//* calls ExitThread (0) *//* Don't assume that the gnulib modules 'write' and 'sigpipe' are

   ARG is of size ARGSIZE, but if that is SIZE_MAX, ARG is a
   null-terminated string.
   OPTIONS specifies the quoting options.
   The returned value points to static storage that can be
   reused by the next call to this function with the same value of N.
   N must be nonnegative; it is typically small, and must be
   less than MIN (INT_MAX, IDX_MAX).  The type of N is signed
   to allow for future extensions (using negative values).  *//* Preallocate a slot 0 buffer, so that the caller can always quote
   one small component of a "memory exhausted" message in slot 0.  *//* A storage slot with size and pointer to a value.  *//* Elide embedded null bytes if we can't return a size.  *//* Like quotearg_buffer (..., ARG, ARGSIZE, O), except return newly
   allocated storage containing the quoted string, and store the
   resulting size into *SIZE, if non-NULL.  The result can contain
   embedded null bytes only if ARGSIZE is not SIZE_MAX, SIZE is not
   NULL, and set_quoting_flags has not set the null byte elision
   flag.  *//* Place into buffer BUFFER (of size BUFFERSIZE) a quoted version of
   argument ARG (of size ARGSIZE), using O to control quoting.
   If O is null, use the default.
   Terminate the output with a null character, and return the written
   size of the output, not counting the terminating null.
   If BUFFERSIZE is too small to store the output string, return the
   value that would have been returned had BUFFERSIZE been large enough.
   If ARGSIZE is SIZE_MAX, use the string length of the argument for
   ARGSIZE.  *//* Don't reuse quote_these_too, since the addition of outer quotes
     sufficiently quotes the specified characters.  *//* Disable read-only scan, and reprocess to write quoted string.  *//* Single shell quotes (') are commonly enough used as an apostrophe,
     that we attempt to minimize the quoting in this case.  Note its
     better to use the apostrophe modifier "\u02BC" if possible, as that
     renders better and works with the word match regex \W+ etc.  *//* Output a multibyte sequence, or an escaped
                   unprintable unibyte character.  *//* Work around a bug with older shells that "see" a '\'
                           that is really the 2nd byte of a multibyte character.
                           In practice the problem is limited to ASCII
                           chars >= '@' that are shell special chars.  *//* Length of multibyte sequence found so far.  *//* If we have a multibyte sequence, copy it until we reach
             its end, find an error, or come back to the initial shift
             state.  For C-like styles, if the sequence has
             unprintable characters, escape the whole sequence, since
             we can't easily escape single characters within it.  *//* These characters don't cause problems, no matter what the
             quoting style is.  They cannot start multibyte sequences.
             A digit or a special letter would cause trouble if it
             appeared at the beginning of quote_string because we'd then
             escape by prepending a backslash.  However, it's hard to
             imagine any locale that would use digits or letters as
             quotes, and set_custom_quoting is documented not to accept
             them.  Also, a digit or a special letter would cause
             trouble if it appeared in quote_these_too, but that's also
             documented as not accepting them.  *//* Just scan string to see if supports a more concise
                     representation, rather than writing a longer string
                     but returning the length of the more concise form.  *//* A shell special character.  In theory, '$' and '`' could
             be the first bytes of multibyte characters, which means
             we should check them with mbrtowc, but in practice this
             doesn't happen so it's not worth worrying about.  *//* special in old /bin/sh, e.g. SunOS 4.1.4 *//* sometimes special in 0th or (with "set -k") later args *//* special in bash *//* sometimes special if isolated *//* fall through *//* No need to escape the escape if we are trying to elide
             outer quotes and nothing else is problematic.  *//* Never need to escape '\' in shell case.  *//* Escape the second '?' in what would otherwise be
                       a trigraph.  *//* We don't have to worry that this last '0' will be
                 backslash-escaped because, again, quote_string should
                 not start with it and because quote_these_too is
                 documented as not accepting it.  *//* If quote_string were to begin with digits, we'd need to
                 test for the end of the arg as well.  However, it's
                 hard to imagine any locale that would use digits in
                 quotes, and set_custom_quoting is documented not to
                 accept them.  Use only a single \0 with shell-escape
                 as currently digits are not printed within $'...'  *//* Use strlen only if we must: when argsize is SIZE_MAX,
                     and when the quote string is more than 1 byte long.
                     If we do call strlen, save the result.  *//* TRANSLATORS:
               Get translations for open and closing quotation marks.
               The message catalog should translate "`" to a left
               quotation mark suitable for the locale, and similarly for
               "'".  For example, a French Unicode local should translate
               these to U+00AB (LEFT-POINTING DOUBLE ANGLE
               QUOTATION MARK), and U+00BB (RIGHT-POINTING DOUBLE ANGLE
               QUOTATION MARK), respectively.

               If the catalog has no translation, we will try to
               use Unicode U+2018 (LEFT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK) and
               Unicode U+2019 (RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK).  If the
               current locale is not Unicode, locale_quoting_style
               will quote 'like this', and clocale_quoting_style will
               quote "like this".  You should always include translations
               for "`" and "'" even if U+2018 and U+2019 are appropriate
               for your locale.

               If you don't know what to put here, please see
               <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_marks_in_other_languages>
               and use glyphs suitable for your language.  *//* Place into buffer BUFFER (of size BUFFERSIZE) a quoted version of
   argument ARG (of size ARGSIZE), using QUOTING_STYLE, FLAGS, and
   QUOTE_THESE_TOO to control quoting.
   Terminate the output with a null character, and return the written
   size of the output, not counting the terminating null.
   If BUFFERSIZE is too small to store the output string, return the
   value that would have been returned had BUFFERSIZE been large enough.
   If ARGSIZE is SIZE_MAX, use the string length of the argument for ARGSIZE.

   This function acts like quotearg_buffer (BUFFER, BUFFERSIZE, ARG,
   ARGSIZE, O), except it breaks O into its component pieces and is
   not careful about errno.  *//* For UTF-8 and GB-18030, use single quotes U+2018 and U+2019.
     Here is a list of other locales that include U+2018 and U+2019:

     None of these is still in wide use; using iconv is overkill.  *//* MSGID approximates a quotation mark.  Return its translation if it

   Return the old value.  Currently, the only values defined for I are
   0 (the default) and 1 (which means to quote the character even if
   it would not otherwise be quoted).  *//* The default quoting options.  *//* Correspondences to quoting style names.  *//* Names of quoting styles.  *//* The right quote for custom_quoting_style.  *//* The left quote for custom_quoting_style.  *//* Quote the characters indicated by this bit vector even if the

   to return to the recorded location.  This function may allocate
   space using malloc (via getcwd) or leave a file descriptor open;
   use free_cwd to perform the necessary free or close.  Upon failure,
   no memory is allocated, any locally opened file descriptors are
   closed;  return non-zero -- in that case, free_cwd need not be
   called, but doing so is ok.  Otherwise, return zero.

   The _raison d'etre_ for this interface is that the working directory
   is sometimes inaccessible, and getcwd is not robust or as efficient.
   So, we prefer to use the open/fchdir approach, but fall back on
   getcwd if necessary.  This module works for most cases with just
   the getcwd-lgpl module, but to be truly robust, use the getcwd module.

   Some systems lack fchdir altogether: e.g., OS/2, pre-2001 Cygwin,
   SCO Xenix.  Also, SunOS 4 and Irix 5.3 provide the function, yet it
   doesn't work for partitions on which auditing is enabled.  If
   you're still using an obsolete system with these problems, please
   send email to the maintainer of this code.  *//* save-cwd.c -- Save and restore current working directory.

     concept of a console attached to a process.
     So, we interpret the three cases as follows:
       - Flag POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP not set: Means, the child process is in the
         same process group as the parent process.  We interpret this as a
         request to reuse the same console.
       - Flag POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP set with attrp->_pgrp == 0: Means the child
         process starts a process group of its own.  See
         <https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/posix_spawnattr_getpgroup.html>
         <https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/setpgrp.html>
         We interpret this as a request to detach from the current console.
       - Flag POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP set with attrp->_pgrp != 0: Means the child
         process joins another, existing process group.  See

  *//* =================== open() and close() with supersede =================== *//* This type holds everything that needs to needs to be remembered in order to
   execute the final rename action.  *//* When writing a file, for some usages it is important that at any moment,
   a process that opens the file will see consistent data in the file.  This
   can be important in two situations:
     * If supersede_if_exists == true, then when the file already existed,
       it is important that a process that opens the file while the new file's
       contents is being written sees consistent data - namely the old file's
       data.
     * If supersede_if_does_not_exist == true, then when the file did not exist,
       it is important that a process that opens the file while the new file's
       contents is being written sees no file (as opposed to a file with
       truncated contents).

   In both situations, the effect is implemented by creating a temporary file,
   writing into that temporary file, and renaming the temporary file when the
   temporary file's contents is complete.

   Note that opening a file with superseding may fail when it would succeed
   without superseding (for example, for a writable file in an unwritable
   directory).  And also the other way around: Opening a file with superseding
   may succeed although it would fail without superseding (for example, for
   an unwritable file in a writable directory).  *//* Written by Bruno Haible, 2020.  *//* Open a file, without destroying an old file with the same name.

     Do not use ASLR-based entropy, as that would leak ASLR info into

   This function returns false only when getrandom fails.
   On GNU systems this should happen only early in the boot process,
   when the fallback should be good enough for programs using tempname
   because any attacker likely has root privileges already.  *//* As this code is used only when high-quality randomness is neither

   We convert the input string to Unicode.

   The standardized Unicode encodings are UTF-8, UCS-2, UCS-4, UTF-16,
   UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UTF-7.  UCS-2 supports only characters up to
   \U0000FFFF.  UTF-16 and variants support only characters up to
   \U0010FFFF.  UTF-7 is way too complex and not supported by glibc-2.1.
   UCS-4 specification leaves doubts about endianness and byte order mark.
   glibc currently interprets it as big endian without byte order mark,
   but this is not backed by an RFC.  So we use UTF-8. It supports
   characters up to \U7FFFFFFF and is unambiguously defined.  *//* Line breaking of strings.

               of 2010-12-27.  On older Linux kernels that lack both
               utimensat and utimes, glibc's futimes rounds instead of
               truncating when falling back on utime.  The same bug
               occurs in futimesat with a null 2nd arg.  *//* If futimesat or futimes fails here, don't try to speed things
           up by returning right away.  glibc can incorrectly fail with
           errno == ENOENT if /proc isn't mounted.  Also, Mandrake 10.0
           in high security mode doesn't allow ordinary users to read
           /proc/self, so glibc incorrectly fails with errno == EACCES.
           If errno == EIO, EPERM, or EROFS, it's probably safe to fail
           right away, but these cases are rare enough that they're not
           worth optimizing, and who knows what other messed-up systems

         where UTIME_OMIT would have worked.

         The same bug occurs in Solaris 11.1 (Apr 2013).

         FIXME: Simplify this for Linux in 2016 and for Solaris in
         2024, when file system bugs are no longer common.  *//* POSIX 2008 added two interfaces to set file timestamps with
     nanosecond resolution; newer Linux implements both functions via
     a single syscall.  We provide a fallback for ENOSYS (for example,
     compiling against Linux 2.6.25 kernel headers and glibc 2.7, but
     running on Linux 2.6.18 kernel).  *//* Some Linux-based NFS clients are buggy, and mishandle timestamps
     of files in NFS file systems in some cases.  We have no
     configure-time test for this, but please see
     <https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=132673> for references to
     some of the problems with Linux 2.6.16.  If this affects you,
     compile with -DHAVE_BUGGY_NFS_TIME_STAMPS; this is reported to
     help in some cases, albeit at a cost in performance.  But you
     really should upgrade your kernel to a fixed version, since the
     problem affects many applications.  *//* Require that at least one of FD or FILE are potentially valid, to avoid
     a Linux bug where futimens (AT_FDCWD, NULL) changes "." rather
     than failing.  *//* Set the access and modification timestamps of FD (a.k.a. FILE) to be
   TIMESPEC[0] and TIMESPEC[1], respectively.
   FD must be either negative -- in which case it is ignored --
   or a file descriptor that is open on FILE.
   If FD is nonnegative, then FILE can be NULL, which means
   use just futimes (or equivalent) instead of utimes (or equivalent),
   and fail if on an old system without futimes (or equivalent).
   If TIMESPEC is null, set the timestamps to the current time.
   Return 0 on success, -1 (setting errno) on failure.  *//* Normalize any UTIME_NOW or UTIME_OMIT values in (*TS)[0] and (*TS)[1],
   using STATBUF to obtain the current timestamps of the file.  If
   both times are UTIME_NOW, set *TS to NULL (as this can avoid some
   permissions issues).  If both times are UTIME_OMIT, return true
   (nothing further beyond the prior collection of STATBUF is
   necessary); otherwise return false.  *//* Work around Linux kernel 2.6.25 bug, where utimensat fails with
     EINVAL if tv_sec is not 0 when using the flag values of tv_nsec.
     Flag a Linux kernel 2.6.32 bug, where an mtime of UTIME_OMIT
     fails to bump ctime.  *//* Validate the requested timestamps.  Return 0 if the resulting
   timespec can be used for utimensat (after possibly modifying it to
   work around bugs in utimensat).  Return a positive value if the
   timespec needs further adjustment based on stat results: 1 if any
   adjustment is needed for utimes, and 2 if any adjustment is needed
   for Linux utimensat.  Return -1, with errno set to EINVAL, if
   timespec is out of range.  *//* Cache variables for whether the utimensat syscall works; used to
   avoid calling the syscall if we know it will just fail with ENOSYS,
   and to avoid unnecessary work in massaging timestamps if the
   syscall will work.  Multiple variables are needed, to distinguish
   between the following scenarios on Linux:
   utimensat doesn't exist, or is in glibc but kernel 2.6.18 fails with ENOSYS
   kernel 2.6.22 and earlier rejects AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW
   kernel 2.6.25 and earlier reject UTIME_NOW/UTIME_OMIT with non-zero tv_sec
   kernel 2.6.32 used with xfs or ntfs-3g fail to honor UTIME_OMIT
   utimensat completely works
   For each cache variable: 0 = unknown, 1 = yes, -1 = no.  *//* Solaris 9 mistakenly succeeds when given a non-directory with a
   trailing slash.  Force the use of rpl_stat for a fix.  *//* Avoid recursion with rpl_futimens or rpl_utimensat.  *//* On native Windows, use SetFileTime; but avoid this when compiling
   GNU Emacs, which arranges for this in some other way and which
   defines WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN itself.  *//* derived from a function in touch.c *//* Set file access and modification times.

       streams.  Some implementations purge unread data, some return
       EBADF, some do nothing.  *//* What POSIX says:
       1) About the file-position indicator (-> fseeko, ftello):
          The file position indicator is incremented by fgetc() and decremented
          by ungetc():
          <https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/fgetc.html>
            "... the fgetc() function shall ... advance the associated file
             position indicator for the stream ..."
          <https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/ungetc.html>
            "The file-position indicator is decremented by each successful
             call to ungetc()..."
       2) fflush discards bytes pushed back by ungetc:
          <https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/fflush.html>
            "...any characters pushed back onto the stream by ungetc()
             or ungetwc() that have not subsequently been read from the
             stream shall be discarded..."
          This implies implicitly: fflush does not change the file position
          indicator.
       3) Effects on the file descriptor, if the file descriptor is capable of
          seeking:
          <https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/fflush.html>
            "...the file offset of the underlying open file description shall
             be set to the file position of the stream..."  *//* GNU libc, BeOS, Haiku, Linux libc5 *//* When stream is NULL, POSIX and C99 only require flushing of "output
     streams and update streams in which the most recent operation was not
     input", and all implementations do this.

     When stream is "an output stream or an update stream in which the most
     recent operation was not input", POSIX and C99 requires that fflush
     writes out any buffered data, and all implementations do this.

     When stream is, however, an input stream or an update stream in
     which the most recent operation was input, C99 specifies nothing,
     and POSIX only specifies behavior if the stream is seekable.
     mingw, in particular, drops the input buffer, leaving the file
     descriptor positioned at the end of the input buffer. I.e. ftell
     (stream) is lost.  We don't want to call the implementation's
     fflush in this case.

     We test ! freading (stream) here, rather than fwriting (stream), because
     what we need to know is whether the stream holds a "read buffer", and on
     mingw this is indicated by _IOREAD, regardless of _IOWRT.  *//* Flush all pending data on STREAM according to POSIX rules.  Both
   output and seekable input streams are supported.  *//* Use a union, since on NetBSD, the compilation flags determine
     whether fpos_t is typedef'd to off_t or a struct containing a
     single off_t member.  *//* fp_->_offset is an fpos_t.  *//* fp_->_offset is typed as an integer.  *//* other implementations *//* Nothing to do.  *//* Minix, AIX, HP-UX, IRIX, OSF/1, Solaris, OpenServer, UnixWare, mingw, MSVC, NonStop Kernel, OpenVMS *//* emx+gcc *//* Clear the stream's ungetc buffer.  May modify the value of ftello (fp).  *//* _IO_free_backup_area is a bit complicated.

 * Compatibility interface for userspace libc header coordination:
 *
 * Define compatibility macros that are used to control the inclusion or
 * exclusion of UAPI structures and definitions in coordination with another
 * userspace C library.
 *
 * This header is intended to solve the problem of UAPI definitions that
 * conflict with userspace definitions. If a UAPI header has such conflicting
 * definitions then the solution is as follows:
 *
 * * Synchronize the UAPI header and the libc headers so either one can be
 *   used and such that the ABI is preserved. If this is not possible then
 *   no simple compatibility interface exists (you need to write translating
 *   wrappers and rename things) and you can't use this interface.
 *
 * Then follow this process:
 *
 * (a) Include libc-compat.h in the UAPI header.
 *      e.g. #include <linux/libc-compat.h>
 *     This include must be as early as possible.
 *
 * (b) In libc-compat.h add enough code to detect that the comflicting
 *     userspace libc header has been included first.
 *
 * (c) If the userspace libc header has been included first define a set of
 *     guard macros of the form __UAPI_DEF_FOO and set their values to 1, else
 *     set their values to 0.
 *
 * (d) Back in the UAPI header with the conflicting definitions, guard the
 *     definitions with:
 *     #if __UAPI_DEF_FOO
 *       ...
 *     #endif
 *
 * This fixes the situation where the linux headers are included *after* the
 * libc headers. To fix the problem with the inclusion in the other order the
 * userspace libc headers must be fixed like this:
 *
 * * For all definitions that conflict with kernel definitions wrap those
 *   defines in the following:
 *   #if !__UAPI_DEF_FOO
 *     ...
 *   #endif

               EOPNOTSUPP is typically seen on NFS mounts.
               ENOTSUP was seen on Quantum StorNext file systems (cvfs).  *//* In the old (original Solaris 10) convention:
               If there are more than 3 entries, there cannot be only the
               ACE_OWNER, ACE_GROUP, ACE_OTHER entries.
               In the newer Solaris 10 and Solaris 11 convention:
               If there are more than 6 entries, there cannot be only the
               ACE_OWNER, ACE_GROUP, ACE_EVERYONE entries, each once with
               NEW_ACE_ACCESS_ALLOWED_ACE_TYPE and once with
               NEW_ACE_ACCESS_DENIED_ACE_TYPE.  *//* Initially, try to read the entries into a stack-allocated buffer.
           Use malloc if it does not fit.  *//* Solaris also has a different variant of ACLs, used in ZFS and NFSv4
         file systems (whereas the other ones are used in UFS file systems).  *//* Don't use MIN_ACL_ENTRIES:  It's set to 4 on Cygwin, but Cygwin
               returns only 3 entries for files with no ACL.  But this is safe:
               If there are more than 4 entries, there cannot be only the
               "user::", "group::", "other:", and "mask:" entries.  *//* Solaris 2.5 through Solaris 10, Cygwin, and contemporaneous versions
         of Unixware.  The acl() call returns the access and default ACL both
         at once.  *//* Solaris, Cygwin, general case *//* Solaris 10 (newer version), which has additional API declared in
         <sys/acl.h> (acl_t) and implemented in libsec (acl_set, acl_trivial,

                 and acl_get_file (name, ACL_TYPE_DEFAULT) on a directory
                 either both succeed or both fail; it depends on the
                 file system.  Therefore there is no point in making the second
                 call if the first one already failed.  *//* On OSF/1, acl_get_file (name, ACL_TYPE_DEFAULT) always
                 returns NULL with errno not set.  There is no point in
                 making this call.  *//* On Mac OS X, acl_get_file (name, ACL_TYPE_ACCESS)
             and acl_get_file (name, ACL_TYPE_DEFAULT)
             always return NULL / EINVAL.  There is no point in making
             these two useless calls.  The real ACL is retrieved through
             acl_get_file (name, ACL_TYPE_EXTENDED).  *//* FreeBSD, Mac OS X, IRIX, Tru64, Cygwin >= 2.5 *//* On Linux, acl_extended_file is an optimized function: It only

   if ACLs are not supported as errno is set in that case also.

   Thread data type: gl_thread_t.

   Creating a thread:
       thread = gl_thread_create (func, arg);
   Or with control of error handling:
       err = glthread_create (&thread, func, arg);
       extern int glthread_create (gl_thread_t *result,
                                   void *(*func) (void *), void *arg);

   Querying and changing the signal mask of a thread (not supported on all
   platforms):
       gl_thread_sigmask (how, newmask, oldmask);
   Or with control of error handling:
       err = glthread_sigmask (how, newmask, oldmask);
       extern int glthread_sigmask (int how, const sigset_t *newmask, sigset_t *oldmask);

   Waiting for termination of another thread:
       gl_thread_join (thread, &return_value);
   Or with control of error handling:
       err = glthread_join (thread, &return_value);
       extern int glthread_join (gl_thread_t thread, void **return_value_ptr);

   Getting a reference to the current thread:
       current = gl_thread_self ();
       extern gl_thread_t gl_thread_self (void);

   Getting a reference to the current thread as a pointer, for debugging:
       ptr = gl_thread_self_pointer ();
       extern void * gl_thread_self_pointer (void);

   Terminating the current thread:
       gl_thread_exit (return_value);
       extern _Noreturn void gl_thread_exit (void *return_value);

   Requesting custom code to be executed at fork() time (not supported on all
   platforms):
       gl_thread_atfork (prepare_func, parent_func, child_func);
   Or with control of error handling:
       err = glthread_atfork (prepare_func, parent_func, child_func);
       extern int glthread_atfork (void (*prepare_func) (void),
                                   void (*parent_func) (void),
                                   void (*child_func) (void));
   Note that even on platforms where this is supported, use of fork() and
   threads together is problematic, see
     <https://lists.gnu.org/r/bug-gnulib/2008-08/msg00062.html>

The
   *REMAINING_DELAY part isn't implemented yet.  *//* Other platforms lacking nanosleep.
   It's not clear whether these are still practical porting targets.
   For now, just fall back on pselect.  *//* Sleep is not interruptible.  So there is no remaining delay.  *//* Implementation for long delays and as fallback.  *//* The requested time has elapsed.  *//* QueryPerformanceCounter failed, but succeeded earlier.
                       Should not happen.  *//* Busy-loop for the rest.  *//* Use Sleep for the longest part.  *//* Wait until the performance counter has reached this value.
                 We don't need to worry about overflow, because the performance
                 counter is reset at reboot, and with a frequency of 3.6E6
                 ticks per second 63 bits suffice for over 80000 years.  *//* Start.  *//* Determine how many ticks to delay.  *//* Number of milliseconds to pass to the Sleep function.
             Since Sleep can take up to 8 ms less or 8 ms more than requested
             (or maybe more if the system is loaded), we subtract 10 ms.  *//* QueryPerformanceFrequency worked.  We can use
             QueryPerformanceCounter.  Use a combination of Sleep and
             busy-looping.  *//* Initialize ticks_per_nanosecond.  *//* For requested delays of one second or more, 15ms resolution is
     sufficient.  *//* Number of performance counter increments per nanosecond,
     or zero if it could not be determined.  *//* The Windows API function Sleep() has a resolution of about 15 ms and takes
   at least 5 ms to execute.  We use this function for longer time periods.
   Additionally, we use busy-looping over short time periods, to get a
   resolution of about 0.01 ms.  In order to measure such short timespans,
   we use the QueryPerformanceCounter() function.  *//* Native Windows platforms.  *//* Verify that time_t is large enough.  *//* nanosleep mishandles large sleeps due to internal overflow problems.
     The worst known case of this is Linux 2.6.9 with glibc 2.3.4, which
     can't sleep more than 24.85 days (2^31 milliseconds).  Similarly,
     cygwin 1.5.x, which can't sleep more than 49.7 days (2^32 milliseconds).
     Solve this by breaking the sleep up into smaller chunks.  *//* written by Jim Meyering
   and Bruno Haible for the native Windows part *//* Provide a replacement for the POSIX nanosleep function.

       HP-UX:          sys_nerr, sys_errlist are declared explicitly above.
       native Windows: sys_nerr, sys_errlist are declared in <stdlib.h>.
       Cygwin:         sys_nerr, sys_errlist are declared in <errno.h>.  *//* NetBSD, HP-UX, native Windows, Cygwin *//* Try to do what strerror (errnum) does, but without clobbering the
       buffer used by strerror().  *//* strerror_r is not declared.  *//* STACKBUF_LEN should have been large enough.  *//* Solaris 10 does not populate buf on ERANGE.  OpenBSD 4.7
       truncates early on ERANGE rather than return a partial integer.
       We prefer the maximal string.  We set buf[0] earlier, and we
       know of no implementation that modifies buf to be an
       unterminated string, so this strlen should be portable in
       practice (rather than pulling in a safer strnlen).  *//* AIX and Haiku return 0 rather than ERANGE when truncating strings; try
       again until we are sure we got the entire string.  *//* Some old implementations may return (-1, EINVAL) instead of EINVAL.
       But on Haiku, valid error numbers are negative.  *//* On HP-UX 11.31, strerror_r always fails when buflen < 80; it
       also fails to change buf on EINVAL.  *//* glibc 2.13 ... 2.34 (at least) don't touch buf upon failure.
             Therefore we have to fall back to strerror_r which, for valid
             errnum, returns a thread-safe untruncated string.  For invalid
             errnum, though, it returns a truncated string, which does not
             allow us to determine whether to return ERANGE or 0.  Thus we
             need to pass a sufficiently large buffer.  *//* ret is 0 upon success, or EINVAL or ERANGE upon failure.  *//* Check for gnulib overrides.  *//* Filter this out now, so that rest of this replacement knows that
     there is room for a non-empty message and trailing NUL.  *//* Although POSIX lets memmove corrupt errno, we don't
     know of any implementation where this is a real problem.  *//* Copy as much of MSG into BUF as possible, without corrupting errno.
   Return 0 if MSG fit in BUFLEN, otherwise return ERANGE.  *//* On MSVC, there is no snprintf() function, just a _snprintf().
   It is of lower quality, but sufficient for the simple use here.
   We only have to make sure to NUL terminate the result (_snprintf
   does not NUL terminate, like strncpy).  *//* This lock protects the buffer returned by strerror().  We assume that
   no other uses of strerror() exist in the program.  *//* Get sys_nerr on Solaris.  *//* Get sys_nerr, sys_errlist on HP-UX (otherwise only declared in C++ mode).
   Get sys_nerr, sys_errlist on IRIX (otherwise only declared with _SGIAPI).  *//* Get catgets internationalization functions.  *//* No locking needed.  *//* Use the system's strerror().  Exclude glibc and cygwin because the
   system strerror_r has the wrong return type, and cygwin 1.7.9
   strerror_r clobbers strerror.  *//* The system's strerror_r function's API is OK, except that its third argument
   is 'int', not 'size_t', or its return type is wrong.  *//* Enable declaration of sys_nerr and sys_errlist in <errno.h> on NetBSD.  *//* Written by Bruno Haible <bruno@clisp.org>, 2010.  *//* strerror_r.c --- POSIX compatible system error routine

   Currently only MinGW is supported.  See the gnulib manual regarding
   Windows sockets.  MinGW has the header files winsock2.h and
   ws2tcpip.h that declare the sys/socket.h definitions we need.  Note
   that you can influence which definitions you get by setting the
   WINVER symbol before including these two files.  For example,
   getaddrinfo is only available if _WIN32_WINNT >= 0x0501 (that
   symbol is set indirectly through WINVER).  You can set this by
   adding AC_DEFINE(WINVER, 0x0501) to configure.ac.  Note that your
   code may not run on older Windows releases then.  My Windows 2000
   box was not able to run the code, for example.  The situation is
   slightly confusing because
   <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/ws2tcpip/nf-ws2tcpip-getaddrinfo>
   suggests that getaddrinfo should be available on all Windows
   releases. *//* For shutdown().  *//* A platform that has <sys/socket.h>.  *//* Get struct iovec.  *//* Code taken from glibc sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/bits/socket.h on

   is defined.  *//* On many platforms, <sys/socket.h> assumes prior inclusion of
   <sys/types.h>.  *//* Special invocation convention:
   - On Cygwin 1.5.x we have a sequence of nested includes
     <sys/socket.h> -> <cygwin/socket.h> -> <asm/socket.h> -> <cygwin/if.h>,
     and the latter includes <sys/socket.h>.  In this situation, the functions
     are not yet declared, therefore we cannot provide the C++ aliases.  *//* This file is supposed to be used on platforms that lack <sys/socket.h>,
   on platforms where <sys/socket.h> cannot be included standalone, and on
   platforms where <sys/socket.h> does not provide all necessary definitions.
   It is intended to provide definitions and prototypes needed by an
   application.  *//* Provide a sys/socket header file for systems lacking it (read: MinGW)
   and for systems where it is incomplete.

     Documentation:
     https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/gnumach-doc/Memory-Attributes.html *//* GNU/Hurd *//* In Mac OS X 10.5, the types vm_address_t, vm_offset_t, vm_size_t have
         32 bits in 32-bit processes and 64 bits in 64-bit processes. Whereas
         mach_vm_address_t and mach_vm_size_t are always 64 bits large.
         Mac OS X 10.5 has three vm_region like methods:
           - vm_region. It has arguments that depend on whether the current
             process is 32-bit or 64-bit. When linking dynamically, this
             function exists only in 32-bit processes. Therefore we use it only
             in 32-bit processes.
           - vm_region_64. It has arguments that depend on whether the current
             process is 32-bit or 64-bit. It interprets a flavor
             VM_REGION_BASIC_INFO as VM_REGION_BASIC_INFO_64, which is
             dangerous since 'struct vm_region_basic_info_64' is larger than
             'struct vm_region_basic_info'; therefore let's write
             VM_REGION_BASIC_INFO_64 explicitly.
           - mach_vm_region. It has arguments that are 64-bit always. This
             function is useful when you want to access the VM of a process
             other than the current process.
         In 64-bit processes, we could use vm_region_64 or mach_vm_region.
         I choose vm_region_64 because it uses the same types as vm_region,
         resulting in less conditional code.  *//* Consider [start,end-1] \ [auxmap_start,auxmap_end-1]
             = [start,auxmap_start-1] u [auxmap_end,end-1].  *//* EOF *//* Read up to memneed bytes from fd into maps.  *//* Allocate memneed bytes of memory.
     We cannot use alloca here, because not much stack space is guaranteed.
     We also cannot use malloc here, because a malloc() call may call mmap()
     and thus pre-allocate available memory.
     So use mmap(), and ignore the resulting VMA.  *//* Construct fname = sprintf (fnamebuf+i, "/proc/%u/map", getpid ()).  *//* Solaris <= 7 *//* We must use the newer /proc interface.
     Documentation:
     https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E23824_01/html/821-1473/proc-4.html
     The contents of /proc/<pid>/map consists of records of type
     prmap_t.  These are different in 32-bit and 64-bit processes,
     but here we are fortunately accessing only the current process.  *//* Construct fname = sprintf (fnamebuf+i, "/proc/%u", getpid ()).  *//* We must use the older /proc interface.  *//* Note: Solaris <sys/procfs.h> defines a different type prmap_t with
     _STRUCTURED_PROC than without! Here's a table of sizeof(prmap_t):
                                  32-bit   64-bit
         _STRUCTURED_PROC = 0       32       56
         _STRUCTURED_PROC = 1       96      104
     Therefore, if the include files provide the newer API, prmap_t has
     the bigger size, and thus you MUST use the newer API.  And if the
     include files provide the older API, prmap_t has the smaller size,
     and thus you MUST use the older API.  *//* IRIX, OSF/1 *//* Invoke the callback.  *//* Invariant: Here vmas[0..i] is sorted.  *//* Invariant: Here vmas[0..i-1] is sorted.  *//* Sort the array in ascending order.
             Better not call qsort(), since it may call malloc().
             Insertion-sort is OK in this case, despite its worst-case running
             time of O(N), since the number of VMAs will rarely be larger than
             1000.  *//* Consider [start,end-1] \ [auxmap_start,auxmap_end-1]
                           = [start,auxmap_start-1] u [auxmap_end,end-1].  *//* Discard empty VMAs and kernel VMAs.  *//* Since 2 * sizeof (vma_t) <= sizeof (prmap_t), we can reuse the
             same memory.  *//* The entries are not sorted by address.  Therefore
             1. Extract the relevant information into an array.
             2. Sort the array in ascending order.
             3. Invoke the callback.  *//* We now have the entire contents of /proc/<pid>/map in memory.  *//* Oops, we had a short read.  Retry.  *//* Read the contents of /proc/<pid>/map in a single system call.
         This guarantees a consistent result (no duplicated or omitted
         entries).  *//* Allocate memneed bytes of memory.
         We cannot use alloca here, because not much stack space is guaranteed.
         We also cannot use malloc here, because a malloc() call may call mmap()
         and thus pre-allocate available memory.
         So use mmap(), and ignore the resulting VMA if it occurs among the
         resulting VMAs.  (Normally it doesn't, because it was allocated after
         the open() call.)  *//* The contents of /proc/<pid>/map contains a number of prmap_t entries,
     then an entirely null prmap_t entry, then a heap of NUL terminated
     strings.
     Documentation: https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.1?topic=files-proc-file
     We read the entire contents, but look only at the prmap_t entries and
     ignore the tail part.  *//* On AIX, there is a /proc/$pic/map file, that contains records of type
     prmap_t, defined in <sys/procfs.h>.  In older versions of AIX, it lists
     only the virtual memory areas that are connected to a file, not the
     anonymous ones.  But at least since AIX 7.1, it is well usable.  *//* On the other platforms, try the /proc approach first, and the sysctl()
     as a fallback.  *//* On FreeBSD with procfs (but not GNU/kFreeBSD, which uses linprocfs), the
     function vma_iterate_proc does not return the virtual memory areas that
     were created by anonymous mmap.  See
     <https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/head/sys/fs/procfs/procfs_map.c?view=markup>
     So use vma_iterate_proc only as a fallback.  *//* || defined __CYGWIN__ *//* sysctl failed, or the list of VMAs is possibly truncated.  *//* And the system call rejects lengths that are not a multiple of
     sizeof (struct kinfo_vmentry).  *//* But the system call rejects lengths > 64 KB.  *//* Allow for small variations over time.  In a multithreaded program

     of entry_size.  *//* But the system call rejects lengths > 1 MB.  *//* If we wanted to have the path of each entry, we would need

                     large enough.  We need the equivalent of full_read().  *//* The buffer was sufficiently large.  *//* Empty file.  *//* Attempt to read the contents in a single system call.  *//* Try the static buffer first.  *//* Open a read-only file stream.  *//* These fields deal with allocation of the buffer.  *//* There is no point in using a stack-allocated buffer if it is too small anyway.  *//* During testing, we want to run into the hairy cases.  *//* On Linux, if the file does not entirely fit into the buffer, the read()
     function stops before the line that would come out truncated.  The
     maximum size of such a line is 73 + PATH_MAX bytes.  To be sure that we
     have read everything, we must verify that at least that many bytes are
     left when read() returned.  *//* Buffered read-only streams.
   We cannot use <stdio.h> here, because fopen() calls malloc(), and a malloc()
   call may call mmap() and thus pre-allocate available memory.
   Also, we cannot use multiple read() calls, because if the buffer size is
   smaller than the file's contents:
     - On NetBSD, the second read() call would return 0, thus making the file
       appear truncated.
     - On DragonFly BSD, the first read() call would fail with errno = EFBIG.
     - On all platforms, if some other thread is doing memory allocations or
       deallocations between two read() calls, there is a high risk that the
       result of these two read() calls don't fit together, and as a
       consequence we will parse garbage and either omit some VMAs or return
       VMAs with nonsensical addresses.
   So use mmap(), and ignore the resulting VMA.  *//* Support for reading text files in the /proc file system.  *//* mquery *//* BeOS, Haiku *//* pstat_getprocvm *//* prmap_t, optionally PIOC* *//* Try to use the newer ("structured") /proc filesystem API, if supported.  *//* mmap, munmap *//* memcpy *//* PIOC*, prmap_t *//* prmap_t *//* sysctl, struct kinfo_vmentry *//* NetBSD, OpenBSD *//* sysctl *//* struct kinfo_vmentry *//* FreeBSD, GNU/kFreeBSD *//* PATH_MAX *//* getpagesize, lseek, read, close, getpid *//* open, O_RDONLY *//* size_t *//* On Solaris in 32-bit mode, when gnulib module 'largefile' is in use,

   All the apparent functions defined here are macros. The idea
   is that you would use these pre-tested macros to solve a
   very specific set of problems, and they would run fast.
   Caution: no side-effects in arguments please!! They may be
   evaluated MANY times!!

   These macros operate a stack of objects.  Each object starts life
   small, and may grow to maturity.  (Consider building a word syllable
   by syllable.)  An object can move while it is growing.  Once it has
   been "finished" it never changes address again.  So the "top of the
   stack" is typically an immature growing object, while the rest of the
   stack is of mature, fixed size and fixed address objects.

   These routines grab large chunks of memory, using a function you
   supply, called 'obstack_chunk_alloc'.  On occasion, they free chunks,
   by calling 'obstack_chunk_free'.  You must define them and declare
   them before using any obstack macros.

   Each independent stack is represented by a 'struct obstack'.
   Each of the obstack macros expects a pointer to such a structure
   as the first argument.

   One motivation for this package is the problem of growing char strings
   in symbol tables.  Unless you are "fascist pig with a read-only mind"
   --Gosper's immortal quote from HAKMEM item 154, out of context--you
   would not like to put any arbitrary upper limit on the length of your
   symbols.

   In practice this often means you will build many short symbols and a
   few long symbols.  At the time you are reading a symbol you don't know
   how long it is.  One traditional method is to read a symbol into a
   buffer, realloc()ating the buffer every time you try to read a symbol
   that is longer than the buffer.  This is beaut, but you still will
   want to copy the symbol from the buffer to a more permanent
   symbol-table entry say about half the time.

   With obstacks, you can work differently.  Use one obstack for all symbol
   names.  As you read a symbol, grow the name in the obstack gradually.
   When the name is complete, finalize it.  Then, if the symbol exists already,
   free the newly read name.

   The way we do this is to take a large chunk, allocating memory from
   low addresses.  When you want to build a symbol in the chunk you just
   add chars above the current "high water mark" in the chunk.  When you
   have finished adding chars, because you got to the end of the symbol,
   you know how long the chars are, and you can create a new object.
   Mostly the chars will not burst over the highest address of the chunk,
   because you would typically expect a chunk to be (say) 100 times as
   long as an average object.

   In case that isn't clear, when we have enough chars to make up
   the object, THEY ARE ALREADY CONTIGUOUS IN THE CHUNK (guaranteed)
   so we just point to it where it lies.  No moving of chars is
   needed and this is the second win: potentially long strings need
   never be explicitly shuffled. Once an object is formed, it does not
   change its address during its lifetime.

   When the chars burst over a chunk boundary, we allocate a larger
   chunk, and then copy the partly formed object from the end of the old
   chunk to the beginning of the new larger chunk.  We then carry on
   accreting characters to the end of the object as we normally would.

   A special macro is provided to add a single char at a time to a
   growing object.  This allows the use of register variables, which
   break the ordinary 'growth' macro.

   Summary:
        We allocate large chunks.
        We carve out one object at a time from the current chunk.
        Once carved, an object never moves.
        We are free to append data of any size to the currently
          growing object.
        Exactly one object is growing in an obstack at any one time.
        You can run one obstack per control block.
        You may have as many control blocks as you dare.
        Because of the way we do it, you can "unwind" an obstack
          back to a previous state. (You may remove objects much
          as you would with a stack.)

   (regoff_t)' bytes long.

   If NUM_REGS == 0, then subsequent matches should allocate their own
   register data.

   freeing the old data.  *//* Relates to 're_match' as 're_search_2' relates to 're_search'.  *//* Like 're_search', but return how many characters in STRING the regexp

   To free the allocated storage, you must call 'regfree' on BUFFER.

   'regfree'.  *//* Sets the current default syntax to SYNTAX, and return the old syntax.

   ((SIZE_MAX - 9) / 10) if _REGEX_LARGE_OFFSETS is defined.

   for ^, because it is difficult to scan the regex backwards to find
   whether ^ should be special.  *//* If this bit is set, a syntactically invalid interval is treated as
   a string of ordinary characters.  For example, the ERE 'a{1' is
   treated as 'a\{1'.  *//* If this bit is set, turn on internal regex debugging.
   If not set, and debugging was on, turn it off.
   This only works if regex.c is compiled -DDEBUG.
   We define this bit always, so that all that's needed to turn on
   debugging is to recompile regex.c; the calling code can always have
   this bit set, and it won't affect anything in the normal case. *//* If this bit is set, do not process the GNU regex operators.
   If not set, then the GNU regex operators are recognized. *//* If this bit is set, succeed as soon as we match the whole pattern,
   without further backtracking.  *//* If this bit is set, then an unmatched ) is ordinary.
   If not set, then an unmatched ) is invalid.  *//* If this bit is set, then an ending range point collating higher
     than the starting range point, as in [z-a], is invalid.
   If not set, then when ending range point collates higher than the
     starting range point, the range is ignored.  *//* If this bit is set, then | is an alternation operator, and \| is literal.
   If not set, then \| is an alternation operator, and | is literal.  *//* If this bit is set, then \<digit> matches <digit>.
   If not set, then \<digit> is a back-reference.  *//* If this bit is set, (...) defines a group, and \( and \) are literals.
   If not set, \(...\) defines a group, and ( and ) are literals.  *//* If this bit is set, then '{...}' defines an interval, and \{ and \}
     are literals.
  If not set, then '\{...\}' defines an interval.  *//* If this bit is set, newline is an alternation operator.
   If not set, newline is literal.  *//* If this bit is set, +, ? and | aren't recognized as operators.
   If not set, they are.  *//* If this bit is set, either \{...\} or {...} defines an
     interval, depending on RE_NO_BK_BRACES.
   If not set, \{, \}, {, and } are literals.  *//* If this bit is set, nonmatching lists [^...] do not match newline.
   If not set, they do.  *//* If this bit is set, then . doesn't match NUL.
   If not set, then it does.  *//* If this bit is set, then . matches newline.
   If not set, then it doesn't.  *//* If this bit is set, then *, +, ?, and { cannot be first in an re or
     immediately after an alternation or begin-group operator.  *//* If this bit is set, then special characters are always special
     regardless of where they are in the pattern.
   If this bit is not set, then special characters are special only in
     some contexts; otherwise they are ordinary.  Specifically,
     * + ? and intervals are only special when not after the beginning,
     open-group, or alternation operator.  *//* If this bit is set, then ^ and $ are always anchors (outside bracket
     expressions, of course).
   If this bit is not set, then it depends:
	^  is an anchor if it is at the beginning of a regular
	   expression or after an open-group or an alternation operator;
	$  is an anchor if it is at the end of a regular expression, or
	   before a close-group or an alternation operator.

   This bit could be (re)combined with RE_CONTEXT_INDEP_OPS, because
   POSIX draft 11.2 says that * etc. in leading positions is undefined.
   We already implemented a previous draft which made those constructs
   invalid, though, so we haven't changed the code back.  *//* If this bit is set, then character classes are supported.  They are:
     [:alpha:], [:upper:], [:lower:],  [:digit:], [:alnum:], [:xdigit:],
     [:space:], [:print:], [:punct:], [:graph:], and [:cntrl:].
   If not set, then character classes are not supported.  *//* If this bit is not set, then + and ? are operators, and \+ and \? are
     literals.
   If set, then \+ and \? are operators and + and ? are literals.  *//* If this bit is not set, then \ inside a bracket expression is literal.
   If set, then such a \ quotes the following character.  *//* The following bits are used to determine the regexp syntax we
   recognize.  The set/not-set meanings are chosen so that Emacs syntax
   remains the value 0.  The bits are given in alphabetical order, and
   the definitions shifted by one from the previous bit; thus, when we
   add or remove a bit, only one other definition need change.  *//* The following two types have to be signed and unsigned integer type
   wide enough to hold a value of a pointer.  For most ANSI compilers
   ptrdiff_t and size_t should be likely OK.  Still size of these two
   types is 2 for Microsoft C.  Ugh... *//* The type of object sizes, in places where the traditional code
   uses unsigned long int.  *//* The type of object sizes.  *//* Use types and values that are wide enough to represent signed and
   unsigned byte offsets in memory.  This currently works only when
   the regex code is used outside of the GNU C library; it is not yet

   A minimal example which provides a growing list of integers can be
   defined like this:

     struct int_array
     {
       // Pointer to result array followed by its length,
       // as required by DYNARRAY_FINAL_TYPE.
       int *array;
       size_t length;
     };

     #define DYNARRAY_STRUCT dynarray_int
     #define DYNARRAY_ELEMENT int
     #define DYNARRAY_PREFIX dynarray_int_
     #define DYNARRAY_FINAL_TYPE struct int_array
     #include <malloc/dynarray-skeleton.c>

   To create a three-element array with elements 1, 2, 3, use this
   code:

     struct dynarray_int dyn;
     dynarray_int_init (&dyn);
     for (int i = 1; i <= 3; ++i)
       {
         int *place = dynarray_int_emplace (&dyn);
         assert (place != NULL);
         *place = i;
       }
     struct int_array result;
     bool ok = dynarray_int_finalize (&dyn, &result);
     assert (ok);
     assert (result.length == 3);
     assert (result.array[0] == 1);
     assert (result.array[1] == 2);
     assert (result.array[2] == 3);
     free (result.array);

   If the elements contain resources which must be freed, define
   DYNARRAY_ELEMENT_FREE appropriately, like this:

     struct str_array
     {
       char **array;
       size_t length;
     };

     #define DYNARRAY_STRUCT dynarray_str
     #define DYNARRAY_ELEMENT char *
     #define DYNARRAY_ELEMENT_FREE(ptr) free (*ptr)
     #define DYNARRAY_PREFIX dynarray_str_
     #define DYNARRAY_FINAL_TYPE struct str_array
     #include <malloc/dynarray-skeleton.c>

   Compared to scratch buffers, dynamic arrays have the following
   features:

   - They have an element type, and are not just an untyped buffer of
     bytes.

   - When growing, previously stored elements are preserved.  (It is
     expected that scratch_buffer_grow_preserve and
     scratch_buffer_set_array_size eventually go away because all
     current users are moved to dynamic arrays.)

   - Scratch buffers have a more aggressive growth policy because
     growing them typically means a retry of an operation (across an
     NSS service module boundary), which is expensive.

   - For the same reason, scratch buffers have a much larger initial
     stack allocation.  *//* Type-safe arrays which grow dynamically.  Shared definitions.

   use of the object.  *//* Before including this file, you need to define:

   DYNARRAY_STRUCT
      The struct tag of dynamic array to be defined.

   DYNARRAY_ELEMENT
      The type name of the element type.  Elements are copied
      as if by memcpy, and can change address as the dynamic
      array grows.

   DYNARRAY_PREFIX
      The prefix of the functions which are defined.

   The following parameters are optional:

   DYNARRAY_ELEMENT_FREE
      DYNARRAY_ELEMENT_FREE (E) is evaluated to deallocate the
      contents of elements. E is of type  DYNARRAY_ELEMENT *.

   DYNARRAY_ELEMENT_INIT
      DYNARRAY_ELEMENT_INIT (E) is evaluated to initialize a new
      element.  E is of type  DYNARRAY_ELEMENT *.
      If DYNARRAY_ELEMENT_FREE but not DYNARRAY_ELEMENT_INIT is
      defined, new elements are automatically zero-initialized.
      Otherwise, new elements have undefined contents.

   DYNARRAY_INITIAL_SIZE
      The size of the statically allocated array (default:
      at least 2, more elements if they fit into 128 bytes).
      Must be a preprocessor constant.  If DYNARRAY_INITIAL_SIZE is 0,
      there is no statically allocated array at, and all non-empty
      arrays are heap-allocated.

   DYNARRAY_FINAL_TYPE
      The name of the type which holds the final array.  If not
      defined, is PREFIX##finalize not provided.  DYNARRAY_FINAL_TYPE
      must be a struct type, with members of type DYNARRAY_ELEMENT and
      size_t at the start (in this order).

   These macros are undefined after this header file has been
   included.

   The following types are provided (their members are private to the
   dynarray implementation):

     struct DYNARRAY_STRUCT

   MAX; "COBn" means "count the number of 1 bits in the low-order n bits".  *//* Types related to integers.  Unless protected by #ifdef _LIBC, the
   regex code should avoid exact-width types like int32_t and uint64_t

   even if the portable character set uses EBCDIC encoding,
   and even if wint_t is wider than int.  *//* In case that the system doesn't have isblank().  *//* The 'dfa' avoids an "unused variable 'dfa'" warning from GCC.  *//* Extended regular expression matching and search library.

   We use WEOF for padding, they indicate that the position isn't
   a first byte of a multibyte character.

   some hairy code in these two functions.  *//* We only need this during the prune_impossible_nodes pass in regexec.c;
     skip it if p_i_n will not run, as calc_inveclosure can be quadratic.  *//* Allocate arrays.  *//* Analyze the structure tree, and calculate "first", "next", "edest",
   "eclosure", and "inveclosure".  *//* The search can be in single byte locale.  *//* Just double check.  *//* Word anchors etc. cannot be handled.  It's okay to test

     Then we add epsilon closures of the nodes which are the next nodes of
     the back-references.  *//* Initial states have the epsilon closure of the node which is
     the first node of the regular expression.  *//* Create initial states for all contexts.  *//* Free the work area which are only used while compiling.  *//* Pacify gcc -Woverflow on 32-bit platformns.  *//* Initialize WORD_CHAR table, which indicate which character is

	 enough space.  This loses if buffer's address is bogus, but
	 that is the user's responsibility.  If ->buffer is NULL this
	 is a simple allocation.  *//* Initialize the dfa.  *//* Initialize the pattern buffer.  *//* Internal entry point.
   Compile the regular expression PATTERN, whose length is LENGTH.
   SYNTAX indicate regular expression's syntax.  *//* _REGEX_RE_COMP *//* Yes, we're discarding 'const' here if !HAVE_LIBINTL.  *//* Match anchors at newlines.  *//* Since 're_exec' always passes NULL for the 'regs' argument, we
     don't need to initialize the pattern buffer fields which affect it.  *//* Make these definitions weak in libc, so POSIX programs can redefine
   these names if they don't use our functions, and still use
   regcomp/regexec above without link errors.  *//* BSD has one and only one pattern buffer.  *//* Entry points compatible with 4.2 BSD regex library.  We don't define
   them unless specifically requested.  *//* Free dynamically allocated space used by PREG.  *//* Set the first 128 bits.  *//* This static array is used for the map to single-byte characters when
   UTF-8 is used.  Otherwise we would allocate memory just to initialize
   it the same all the time.  UTF-8 is the preferred encoding so this is
   a worthwhile optimization.  *//* Includes the null.  *//* Only error codes returned by the rest of the code should be passed
       to this routine.  If we are given anything else, or if other regex
       code generates an invalid error code, then the program has a bug.
       Dump core so we can fix it.  *//* Returns a message corresponding to an error code, ERRCODE, returned
   from either regcomp or regexec.   We don't use PREG here.  *//* Some error occurred while compiling the expression.  *//* Compute the fastmap now, since regexec cannot modify the pattern
       buffer.  This function never fails in this implementation.  *//* We have already checked preg->fastmap != NULL.  *//* POSIX doesn't distinguish between an unmatched open-group and an
     unmatched close-group: both are REG_EPAREN.  *//* It also changes the matching behavior.  *//* REG_NEWLINE implies neither . nor [^...] match newline.  *//* If REG_NEWLINE is set, newlines are treated differently.  *//* Try to allocate space for the fastmap.  *//* regcomp takes a regular expression as a string and compiles it.

   PREG is a regex_t *.  We do not expect any fields to be initialized,
   since POSIX says we shouldn't.  Thus, we set

     'buffer' to the compiled pattern;
     'used' to the length of the compiled pattern;
     'syntax' to RE_SYNTAX_POSIX_EXTENDED if the
       REG_EXTENDED bit in CFLAGS is set; otherwise, to
       RE_SYNTAX_POSIX_BASIC;
     'newline_anchor' to REG_NEWLINE being set in CFLAGS;
     'fastmap' to an allocated space for the fastmap;
     'fastmap_accurate' to zero;
     're_nsub' to the number of subexpressions in PATTERN.

   PATTERN is the address of the pattern string.

   CFLAGS is a series of bits which affect compilation.

     If REG_EXTENDED is set, we use POSIX extended syntax; otherwise, we
     use POSIX basic syntax.

     If REG_NEWLINE is set, then . and [^...] don't match newline.
     Also, regexec will try a match beginning after every newline.

     If REG_ICASE is set, then we considers upper- and lowercase
     versions of letters to be equivalent when matching.

     If REG_NOSUB is set, then when PREG is passed to regexec, that
     routine will report only success or failure, and nothing about the
     registers.

   It returns 0 if it succeeds, nonzero if it doesn't.  (See regex.h for
   the return codes and their meanings.)  *//* Entry point for POSIX code.  *//* ... Else catch all bytes which can start the mbchars.  *//* See if we have to start the match at all multibyte characters,
	     i.e. where we would not find an invalid sequence.  This only
	     applies to multibyte character sets; for single byte character
	     sets, the SIMPLE_BRACKET again suffices.  *//* See if we have to try all bytes which start multiple collation
	     elements.
	     e.g. In da_DK, we want to catch 'a' since "aa" is a valid
		  collation element, and don't catch 'b' since 'b' is
		  the only collation element which starts from 'b' (and
		  it is caught by SIMPLE_BRACKET).  *//* Helper function for re_compile_fastmap.
   Compile fastmap for the initial_state INIT_STATE.  *//* Specify the precise syntax of regexps for compilation.  This provides
   for compatibility for various utilities which historically have
   different, incompatible syntaxes.

   The argument SYNTAX is a bit mask comprised of the various bits
   defined in regex.h.  We return the old syntax.  *//* This has no initializer because initialized variables in Emacs
   become read-only after dumping.  *//* Set by 're_set_syntax' to the current regexp syntax to recognize.  Can
   also be assigned to arbitrarily: each pattern buffer stores its own
   syntax, so it can be changed between regex compilations.  *//* Match anchors at newline.  *//* And GNU code determines whether or not to get register information
     by passing null for the REGS argument to re_match, etc., not by
     setting no_sub, unless RE_NO_SUB is set.  *//* re_compile_pattern is the GNU regular expression compiler: it
   compiles PATTERN (of length LENGTH) and puts the result in BUFP.
   Returns 0 if the pattern was valid, otherwise an error string.

   Assumes the 'allocated' (and perhaps 'buffer') and 'translate' fields
   are set in BUFP on entry.  *//* Entry points for GNU code.  *//* REG_ERPAREN *//* REG_ESIZE *//* REG_EEND *//* REG_BADRPT *//* REG_ESPACE *//* REG_ERANGE *//* REG_BADBR *//* REG_EBRACE *//* REG_EPAREN *//* REG_EBRACK *//* REG_ESUBREG *//* REG_EESCAPE *//* REG_ECTYPE *//* REG_ECOLLATE *//* REG_BADPAT *//* REG_NOMATCH *//* REG_NOERROR *//* This table gives an error message for each of the error codes listed
   in regex.h.  Obviously the order here has to be same as there.
   POSIX doesn't require that we do anything for REG_NOERROR,
   but why not be nice?  */dup_elem/home/arun/Desktop/TakeDownHSS/CodeQL/RealWorldRepos/gettext/gettext-tools/libgrep/malloc/dynarray-skeleton.cregmatch_list_finalizeregmatch_list *finalizeDYNARRAY_PREFIXregmatch_list_DYNARRAY_NAME (f)regmatch_list_freeregmatch_t[8]struct <unnamed>[8]DYNARRAY_INITIAL_SIZEsizeof (DYNARRAY_ELEMENT)regmatch_list_clearfree__elements__regmatch_list_remove_lastremove_lastregmatch_list_resize!okmark_failedregmatch_list_emplaceemplacehas_failedconst regmatch_listconst regmatch_list *list->u.dynarray_header.used == list->u.dynarray_header.allocatedemplace__emplace__tail__regmatch_list_emplace__!__libc_dynarray_emplace_enlarge (&list->u.dynarray_abstract, DYNARRAY_SCRATCH (list), sizeof (DYNARRAY_ELEMENT))!gl_dynarray_emplace_enlarge (&list->u.dynarray_abstract, (list)->scratch, sizeof (regmatch_t))regmatch_list_emplace__tail__regmatch_list_addaddadd__regmatch_list_add__regmatch_list_endregmatch_list_beginregmatch_list_atindex >= DYNARRAY_NAME (size) (list)index >= regmatch_list_size (list)regmatch_list_sizeregmatch_list_mark_failedfree__array__regmatch_list_has_failedregmatch_list_freeregmatch_list_initregmatch_list_free__array__regmatch_list_free__elements__regmatch_listdynarray_abstractDYNARRAY_FINAL_TYPEDYNARRAY_ELEMENT_INITDYNARRAY_ELEMENT_FREEDYNARRAY_ELEMENTDYNARRAY_STRUCTDYNARRAY_HAVE_SCRATCHDYNARRAY_SCRATCHDYNARRAY_NAMEDYNARRAY_CONCAT1DYNARRAY_CONCAT0DYNARRAY_SCRATCH(list)(list)->scratchDYNARRAY_FREEDYNARRAY_CONCAT1 (DYNARRAY_NAME (f), ree)DYNARRAY_NAME(name)DYNARRAY_CONCAT1(DYNARRAY_PREFIX, name)DYNARRAY_CONCAT1(prefix,name)DYNARRAY_CONCAT0(prefix, name)DYNARRAY_CONCAT0(prefix,name)prefix ## name(sizeof (DYNARRAY_ELEMENT) > 64 ? 2 : 128 / sizeof (DYNARRAY_ELEMENT))DYNARRAY_INITIAL_SIZE < 0DYNARRAY_INITIAL_SIZE > 0defined (DYNARRAY_ELEMENT_INIT)defined (DYNARRAY_ELEMENT_FREE)!(defined (DYNARRAY_ELEMENT_INIT) || defined (DYNARRAY_ELEMENT_FREE))/* Undo macro definitions.  *//* !DYNARRAY_FINAL_TYPE *//* On error, we need to free all data.  *//* On success, the result owns all the data.  *//* free__elements__ does nothing if the list is in the failed

   DYNARRAY_STRUCT
      The struct tag of dynamic array to be defined.
   DYNARRAY_ELEMENT
      The type name of the element type.  Elements are copied
      as if by memcpy, and can change address as the dynamic
      array grows.
   DYNARRAY_PREFIX
      The prefix of the functions which are defined.

   The following parameters are optional:

   DYNARRAY_ELEMENT_FREE
      DYNARRAY_ELEMENT_FREE (E) is evaluated to deallocate the
      contents of elements. E is of type  DYNARRAY_ELEMENT *.
   DYNARRAY_ELEMENT_INIT
      DYNARRAY_ELEMENT_INIT (E) is evaluated to initialize a new
      element.  E is of type  DYNARRAY_ELEMENT *.
      If DYNARRAY_ELEMENT_FREE but not DYNARRAY_ELEMENT_INIT is
      defined, new elements are automatically zero-initialized.
      Otherwise, new elements have undefined contents.
   DYNARRAY_INITIAL_SIZE
      The size of the statically allocated array (default:
      at least 2, more elements if they fit into 128 bytes).
      Must be a preprocessor constant.  If DYNARRAY_INITIAL_SIZE is 0,
      there is no statically allocated array at, and all non-empty
      arrays are heap-allocated.
   DYNARRAY_FINAL_TYPE
      The name of the type which holds the final array.  If not
      defined, is PREFIX##finalize not provided.  DYNARRAY_FINAL_TYPE
      must be a struct type, with members of type DYNARRAY_ELEMENT and
      size_t at the start (in this order).

   These macros are undefined after this header file has been
   included.

   The following types are provided (their members are private to the
   dynarray implementation):

     struct DYNARRAY_STRUCT

   The following functions are provided:

     void DYNARRAY_PREFIX##init (struct DYNARRAY_STRUCT *);
     void DYNARRAY_PREFIX##free (struct DYNARRAY_STRUCT *);
     bool DYNARRAY_PREFIX##has_failed (const struct DYNARRAY_STRUCT *);
     void DYNARRAY_PREFIX##mark_failed (struct DYNARRAY_STRUCT *);
     size_t DYNARRAY_PREFIX##size (const struct DYNARRAY_STRUCT *);
     DYNARRAY_ELEMENT *DYNARRAY_PREFIX##begin (const struct DYNARRAY_STRUCT *);
     DYNARRAY_ELEMENT *DYNARRAY_PREFIX##end (const struct DYNARRAY_STRUCT *);
     DYNARRAY_ELEMENT *DYNARRAY_PREFIX##at (struct DYNARRAY_STRUCT *, size_t);

     void DYNARRAY_PREFIX##remove_last (struct DYNARRAY_STRUCT *);
     void DYNARRAY_PREFIX##clear (struct DYNARRAY_STRUCT *);

   The following functions are provided are provided if the
   prerequisites are met:

     bool DYNARRAY_PREFIX##finalize (struct DYNARRAY_STRUCT *,
                                     DYNARRAY_FINAL_TYPE *);
       (if DYNARRAY_FINAL_TYPE is defined)
     DYNARRAY_ELEMENT *DYNARRAY_PREFIX##finalize (struct DYNARRAY_STRUCT *,
                                                  size_t *);
       (if DYNARRAY_FINAL_TYPE is not defined)
*//* Type-safe arrays which grow dynamically.

   Rules: We throw away the Node 'a' in the STATE_LOG[STR_IDX] if...
     1. When STR_IDX == MATCH_LAST(the last index in the state_log):
	If 'a' isn't the LAST_NODE and 'a' can't epsilon transit to
	the LAST_NODE, we throw away the node 'a'.
     2. When 0 <= STR_IDX < MATCH_LAST and 'a' accepts
	string 's' and transit to 'b':
	i. If 'b' isn't in the STATE_LOG[STR_IDX+strlen('s')], we throw
	   away the node 'a'.
	ii. If 'b' is in the STATE_LOG[STR_IDX+strlen('s')] but 'b' is
	    thrown away, we throw away the node 'a'.
     3. When 0 <= STR_IDX < MATCH_LAST and 'a' epsilon transit to 'b':
	i. If 'b' isn't in the STATE_LOG[STR_IDX], we throw away the
	   node 'a'.
	ii. If 'b' is in the STATE_LOG[STR_IDX] but 'b' is thrown away,
	    we throw away the node 'a'.  *//* We completed a subexpression, but it may be part of
		   an optional one, so do not update PREV_IDX_MATCH.  *//* We transited through an empty match for an optional

		 epsilon-transition if the first was already considered.  *//* Pick a valid destination, or return -1 if none is found.  *//* Compute the next node to which "NFA" transit from NODE("NFA" is a NFA
   corresponding to the DFA).
   Return the destination node, and update EPS_VIA_NODES;
   return -1 on match failure, -2 on error.  *//* Check the halt state STATE match the current context.
   Return 0 if not match, if the node, STATE has, is a halt node and
   match the context, return the node.  *//* Check NODE match the current context.  *//* We found a match, do not modify match_first below.  *//* We found an appropriate halt state.  *//* Reached a halt state.
	     Check the halt state can satisfy the current context.  *//* Reached the invalid state or an error.  Try to recover a valid
	     state using the state log, if available and if we have not
	     already found a valid (even if not the longest) match.  *//* If the RE accepts NULL string.  *//* Check OP_OPEN_SUBEXP in the initial state in case that we use them
	 later.  E.g. Processing back references.  *//* An initial state must not be NULL (invalid).  *//* Check whether the regular expression match input string INPUT or not,
   and return the index where the matching end.  Return -1 if
   there is no match, and return -2 in case of an error.
   FL_LONGEST_MATCH means we want the POSIX longest matching.
   If P_MATCH_FIRST is not NULL, and the match fails, it is set to the
   next place where we may want to try matching.
   Note that the matcher assumes that the matching starts from the current
   index of the buffer.  *//* It is relatively rare case, then calculate on demand.  *//* Acquire an initial state and return it.
   We must select appropriate initial state depending on the context,
   since initial states may have constraints like "\<", "^", etc..  *//* At last, add the offset to each register, since we slid
	 the buffers so that we could assume that the matching starts
	 from 0.  *//* FIXME: This function should fail if mctx.match_last exceeds
	 the maximum possible regoff_t value.  We need a new error
	 code REG_OVERFLOW.  *//* Set the points where matching start/end.  *//* Initialize registers.  *//* Set pmatch[] if we need.  *//* We found a match.  *//* We assume that the matching starts from 0.  *//* It seems to be appropriate one, then use the matcher.  *//* Don't consider this char as a possible match start if it part,
         yet isn't the head, of a multibyte character.  *//* Reconstruct the buffers so that the matcher can assume that
	 the matching starts from the beginning of the buffer.  *//* Use buffer byte if OFFSET is in buffer, otherwise '\0'.  *//* If MATCH_FIRST is out of the valid range, reconstruct the
		 buffers.  *//* In this case, we can't determine easily the current byte,
	     since it might be a component byte of a multibyte
	     character.  Then we use the constructed buffer instead.  *//* Fastmap without multi-byte translation, match backwards.  *//* Fastmap without translation, match forward.  *//* Fastmap with single-byte translation, match forward.  *//* No fastmap.  *//* Advance as rapidly as possible through the string, until we
	 find a plausible place to start matching.  This may be done
	 with varying efficiency, so there are various possibilities:
	 only the most common of them are specialized, in order to
	 save on code size.  We use a switch statement for speed.  *//* Check incrementally whether the input string matches.  *//* We will log all the DFA states through which the dfa pass,
     if nmatch > 1, or this dfa has "multibyte node", which is a
     back-reference or a node which can accept multibyte character or
     multi character collating element.  *//* We must check the longest matching, if nmatch > 0.  *//* If initial states with non-begbuf contexts have no elements,
     the regex must be anchored.  If preg->newline_anchor is set,
     we'll never use init_state_nl, so do not check it.  *//* We assume front-end functions already check them.  *//* Check if the DFA haven't been compiled.  *//* Searches for a compiled pattern PREG in the string STRING, whose
   length is LENGTH.  NMATCH, PMATCH, and EFLAGS have the same
   meaning as with regexec.  LAST_START is START + RANGE, where
   START and RANGE have the same meaning as with re_search.
   Return REG_NOERROR if we find a match, and REG_NOMATCH if not,
   otherwise return the error code.
   Note: We assume front end functions already check ranges.
   (0 <= LAST_START && LAST_START <= LENGTH)  *//* Internal entry point.  *//* Set REGS to hold NUM_REGS registers, storing them in STARTS and
   ENDS.  Subsequent matches using PATTERN_BUFFER and REGS will use
   this memory for recording register information.  STARTS and ENDS
   must be allocated using the malloc library routine, and must each
   be at least NUM_REGS * sizeof (regoff_t) bytes long.

   If NUM_REGS == 0, then subsequent matches should allocate their own
   register data.

   Unless this function is called, the first search or match using
   PATTERN_BUFFER will allocate its own register data, without
   freeing the old data.  *//* Copy the regs.  *//* This function may not be called with REGS_FIXED and nregs too big.  *//* Yes.  If we need more elements than were already
	 allocated, reallocate them.  If we need fewer, just
	 leave it alone.  *//* No.  So allocate them with malloc.  *//* Have the register data arrays been allocated?  *//* We need one extra element beyond 'num_regs' for the '-1' marker GNU code
     uses.  *//* If caller wants register contents data back, copy them.  *//* I hope we needn't fill their regs with -1's when no match was found.  *//* Nothing can be copied to regs.  *//* We need at least 1 register.  *//* Compile fastmap if we haven't yet.  *//* Check for out-of-range.  *//* The parameters have the same meaning as those of re_search.
   Additional parameters:
   If RET_LEN is true the length of the match is returned (re_match style);
   otherwise the position of the match is returned.  *//* Concatenate the strings.  *//* re_match, re_search, re_match_2, re_search_2

   The former two functions operate on STRING with length LENGTH,
   while the later two operate on concatenation of STRING1 and STRING2
   with lengths LENGTH1 and LENGTH2, respectively.

   re_match() matches the compiled pattern in BUFP against the string,
   starting at index START.

   re_search() first tries matching at index START, then it tries to match
   starting from index START + 1, and so on.  The last start position tried
   is START + RANGE.  (Thus RANGE = 0 forces re_search to operate the same
   way as re_match().)

   The parameter STOP of re_{match,search}_2 specifies that no match exceeding
   the first STOP characters of the concatenation of the strings should be
   concerned.

   If REGS is not NULL, and BUFP->no_sub is not set, the offsets of the match
   and all groups is stored in REGS.  (For the "_2" variants, the offsets are
   computed relative to the concatenation, not relative to the individual
   strings.)

   On success, re_match* functions return the length of the match, re_search*
   return the position of the start of the match.  They return -1 on
   match failure, -2 on error.  *//* regexec searches for a given pattern, specified by PREG, in the
   string STRING.

   If NMATCH is zero or REG_NOSUB was set in the cflags argument to
   'regcomp', we ignore PMATCH.  Otherwise, we assume PMATCH has at
   least NMATCH elements, and we set them to the offsets of the
   corresponding matched substrings.

   EFLAGS specifies "execution flags" which affect matching: if
   REG_NOTBOL is set, then ^ does not match at the beginning of the
   string; if REG_NOTEOL is set, then $ does not match at the end.

   Return 0 if a match is found, REG_NOMATCH if not, REG_BADPAT if
   EFLAGS is invalid.  */states_nodestates_chcache/home/arun/Desktop/TakeDownHSS/CodeQL/RealWorldRepos/gettext/gettext-tools/libgrep/regex.c"regexec.c""regcomp.c""regex_internal.c""regex_internal.h"__GNUC_PREREQ (4, 6)GCC diagnostic ignored "-Wold-style-definition"defined __cplusplus && defined _LIBCSHLIB_COMPAT (libc, GLIBC_2_0, GLIBC_2_3)/* Binary backward compatibility.  *//* On some systems, limits.h sets RE_DUP_MAX to a lower value than

   https://unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-numbers.html#Plural_rules_syntax

   This implementation only supports the "preferred" form, which
   doesn't support obsolete keywords "in", "is", "not", and "within".

   Unlike gettext, CLDR allows an unsigned decimal value as an
   operand, in addition to unsigned integers.  For simplicity, we
   treat decimal relations as if it has a constant truth value.

   The implementation is largely based on the idea of Michele Locati's

   - starts with '%' or '%|'; in the latter case it must end in '|',
   - is continued either by
       - 'm%' where m is a positive integer, starting with a nonzero digit;
         in this case the directive must not have started with '%|'; or

             nonzero digit,
           - optional: any of the characters '#', '0', '-', ' ', '+', "'",
             '_', '=', 'h', 'l',
           - optional: a width specification: '*' (reads an argument) or '*m$'
             or a nonempty digit sequence,
           - optional: a '.' and a precision specification: '*' (reads an
             argument) or '*m$' or a nonempty digit sequence,
           - optional: any of the characters 'h', 'l', 'L',
           - if the directive started with '%|':
               an optional specifier and a final '|',
             otherwise
               a mandatory specifier.
             If no specifier is given, it needs an argument of any type.
             The possible specifiers are:
               - 'c', 'C', that need a character argument,
               - 's', 'S', that need an argument of any type,
               - 'i', 'd', 'o', 'u', 'x', 'X', that need an integer argument,
               - 'e', 'E', 'f', 'g', 'G', that need a floating-point argument,
               - 'p', that needs a 'void *' argument,
               - 't', that doesn't need an argument,
               - 'TX', where X is any character, that doesn't need an argument,
               - 'n', that needs a pointer to integer.
             The Boost format string interpreter doesn't actually care about
             the argument types, but we do, because it increases the likelihood
             of detecting translator mistakes.
   Numbered ('%m%' or '%m$' or '*m$') and unnumbered argument specifications
   cannot be used in the same string.

   A directive
   - starts with '%' or '%m$' where m is a positive integer,
   - is optionally followed by any of the characters '#', '0', '-', ' ', '+',
     "'", or - only in msgstr strings - the string "I", each of which acts as
     a flag,
   - is optionally followed by a width specification: '*' (reads an argument)
     or '*m$' or a nonempty digit sequence,
   - is optionally followed by '.' and a precision specification: '*' (reads
     an argument) or '*m$' or a nonempty digit sequence,
   - is either continued like this:
       - is optionally followed by a size specifier, one of 'hh' 'h' 'l' 'll'
         'L' 'q' 'j' 'z' 't',
       - is finished by a specifier
           - '%', that needs no argument,
           - 'c', 'C', that need a character argument,
           - 's', 'S', that need a string argument,
           - 'i', 'd', that need a signed integer argument,
           - 'o', 'u', 'x', 'X', that need an unsigned integer argument,
           - 'e', 'E', 'f', 'F', 'g', 'G', 'a', 'A', that need a floating-point
             argument,
           - 'p', that needs a 'void *' argument,
           - 'n', that needs a pointer to integer.
     or is finished by a specifier '<' inttypes-macro '>' where inttypes-macro
     is an ISO C 99 section 7.8.1 format directive.
   Numbered ('%m$' or '*m$') and unnumbered argument specifications cannot
   be used in the same string.  When numbered argument specifications are
   used, specifying the Nth argument requires that all the leading arguments,
   from the first to the (N-1)th, are specified in the format string.

   numberFormatPattern see DecimalFormat.applyPattern

   choiceFormatPattern see ChoiceFormat constructor

   In strings, literal curly braces can be used if quoted between single
   quotes.  A real single quote is represented by ''.

   If a pattern is used, then unquoted braces in the pattern, if any, must
   match: that is, "ab {0} de" and "ab '}' de" are ok, but "ab {0'}' de" and
   "ab } de" are not.

   The argument is a number from 0 to 9, which corresponds to the arguments
   presented in an array to be formatted.

   It is ok to have unused arguments in the array.

   Adding a dateFormatPattern / numberFormatPattern / choiceFormatPattern
   to an elementFormat is equivalent to creating a SimpleDateFormat /
   DecimalFormat / ChoiceFormat and use of setFormat. For example,

     MessageFormat form =
       new MessageFormat("The disk \"{1}\" contains {0,choice,0#no files|1#one file|2#{0,number} files}.");

   is equivalent to

     MessageFormat form = new MessageFormat("The disk \"{1}\" contains {0}.");
     form.setFormat(1, // Number of {} occurrence in the string!
                    new ChoiceFormat(new double[] { 0, 1, 2 },
                                     new String[] { "no files", "one file",
                                                    "{0,number} files" }));

   Note: The behaviour of quotes inside a choiceFormatPattern is not clear.
   Example 1:
     "abc{1,choice,0#{1,number,00';'000}}def"
       JDK 1.1.x: exception
       JDK 1.3.x: behaves like "abc{1,choice,0#{1,number,00;000}}def"
   Example 2:
     "abc{1,choice,0#{1,number,00';'}}def"
       JDK 1.1.x: interprets the semicolon as number suffix
       JDK 1.3.x: behaves like "abc{1,choice,0#{1,number,00;}}def"

 * Anything else would have to be translated to UTF8 before being

   A directive
     - starts with '%',
     - is followed by a non-zero digit and optionally more digits. All
       the following digits are eaten up.
   An unterminated directive ('%' not followed by a digit or at the end) is
   not an error.
   %1 denotes the first argument, %2 the second argument, etc.
   The set of used argument numbers must be of the form {1,...,n} or
   {1,...,n} \ {m}: one of the supplied arguments may be ignored by the
   format string. This allows the processing of singular forms (msgstr[0]).
   Which argument may be skipped, depends on the argument types at runtime;
   since xgettext cannot extract this info, it is considered unknown here.  *//* KDE format strings.

   - is optionally followed by any of the characters '-', '^', '0', '+', ' ',
     each of which acts as a flag,
   - is optionally followed by a width specification: a nonempty digit

     digit sequence,
   - is finished by a specifier
       - '%', that needs no argument,
       - 'c', that need a character argument,
       - 'd', 'x', 'X', 'o', that need an integer argument,
       - 's', that need an argument and prints it using princ,
       - 'S', that need an argument and prints it using prin1.
   Numbered ('%m$') and unnumbered argument specifications can be used in the
   same string. The effect of '%m$' is to set the current argument number to
   m. The current argument number is incremented after processing a directive.

   Additionally there is the directive '%%', which takes no argument.

   Note: Lua does not distinguish between integer, floating-point
   and character arguments, since it has a number data type only.
   However, we should not allow users to use %d instead of %c.
   The same applies to %s and %q - we should not allow intermixing them.

       - 'e', 'E', 'f', 'F', 'g', 'G', that need a floating-point argument,
       - 'n', that needs a pointer to integer.
   So there can be numbered argument specifications:
   - '%m$' for the format string,
   - '*m$v' for the vector,
   - '*m$' for the width,
   - '.*m$' for the precision.
   Numbered and unnumbered argument specifications can be used in the same
   string. The effect of '%m$' is to take argument number m, without affecting
   the current argument number. The current argument number is incremented

     2. Built-in Types, Exceptions and Functions
     2.1. Built-in Types
     2.1.5. Sequence Types
     2.1.5.2. String Formatting Operations
   Any string or Unicode string can act as format string via the '%' operator,
   implemented in stringobject.c and unicodeobject.c.
   A directive
   - starts with '%'
   - is optionally followed by '(ident)' where ident is any sequence of
     characters with balanced left and right parentheses,
   - is optionally followed by any of the characters '-' (left justification),
     '+' (sign), ' ' (blank), '#' (alt), '0' (zero), each of which acts as a
     flag,
   - is optionally followed by a width specification: '*' (reads an argument)
     or a nonempty digit sequence,
   - is optionally followed by '.' and a precision specification: '*' (reads
     an argument) or a nonempty digit sequence,
   - is optionally followed by a size specifier, one of 'h' 'l' 'L'.
   - is finished by a specifier
       - '%', that needs no argument,
       - 'c', that needs a character argument,
       - 's', 'r', that need a string argument (or, when a precision of 0 is
         given, an argument of any type),
       - 'i', 'd', 'u', 'o', 'x', 'X', that need an integer argument,
       - 'e', 'E', 'f', 'g', 'G', that need a floating-point argument.
   Use of '(ident)' and use of unnamed argument specifications are exclusive,
   because the first requires a mapping as argument, while the second requires
   a tuple as argument. When unnamed arguments are used, the number of
   arguments in the format string and the number of elements in the argument
   tuple (to the right of the '%' operator) must be the same.
 *//* Python format strings.

   A directive
     - starts with '%',
     - is optionally followed by 'L' (indicates locale-dependent processing),
     - is followed by one or two digits ('0' to '9'). %0n is equivalent to %n.
   An unterminated directive ('%' or '%L' not followed by a digit or at the
   end) is not an error.
   The first .arg() invocation replaces the %n with the lowest numbered n,
   the next .arg() invocation then replaces the %n with the second-lowest
   numbered n, and so on.
   This is inherently buggy because a '%' in the first replacement confuses
   the second .arg() invocation.
   To reduce this problem and introduce another one, there are also .arg()
   methods that take up to 9 strings and perform the replacements in one swoop.
   But this method works only on strings that contain no 'L' flags and only
   single-digit argument designators.
   Although %0 is supported, usually %1 denotes the first argument, %2 the
   second argument etc.  *//* Qt format strings.

   A format string consists of literal text and directives.
   A directive
   - starts with '%',
   - is optionally followed by a sequence of the following:
     - any of the characters ' ', '#', '+', '-', '0', each of which acts as a
       flag,
     - a digit sequence starting with a non-zero digit, followed by '$', at
       most once per directive, indicating a positional argument to consume,
     - '<' KEY '>', at most once per directive, indicating a hash table element
       to consume,
     - a digit sequence starting with a non-zero digit, specifying a width,
     - '*', indicating a width, taken from the argument list,
     - '*' and a digit sequence, followed by '$', indicating a width, taken
       from a positional argument,
     - '.' and a digit sequence, indicating a precision,
     - '.' '*', indicating a precision, taken from the argument list,
     - '.' '*' and a digit sequence, followed by '$', indicating a precision,
       taken from a positional argument.
     This sequence is in any order, except that
       - flags must occur before width and precision,
       - width must occur before precision.
   - is finished by a specifier
     - 's', that takes an object to print without double-quote delimiters,
     - 'p', that takes an object to print with double-quote delimiters (in case
       of a string),
     - '{' KEY '}', indicating a hash table element to consume and to print
       like with 's',
     - 'c', that takes a character,
     - 'd', 'i', 'u', 'o', 'x', 'X', 'b', 'B', that take an integer,
     - 'f', 'g', 'G', 'e', 'E', 'a', 'A', that take a floating-point number.
   Additionally there are the directives '%%' '%<newline>', which take no
   argument.
   Numbered, unnumbered, and named argument specifications cannot be used in
   the same string; either all arguments are numbered, or all arguments are
   unnumbered, or all arguments are named.
